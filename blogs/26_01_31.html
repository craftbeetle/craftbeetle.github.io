            <p>
                Ever since Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on the 7th of October, 2023 I have learned so much about Palestine,
                the Zionist Entity known as Israel, and through them I have learned about America and the world. My
                understanding of the United States in particular and the West in general has greatly increased as I
                learn about Zionism. There are clear parallels, the two are fun-house mirror reflections of each other,
                one image over-exaggerating aspects of the other.<br><br>

                Are you holding your breath that Israelis will revolt and dismantle the Zionist state for the benefit of
                Palestine and the rest of West Asia and North Africa? Do you believe that there is class solidarity
                between Israeli workers and Palestinian workers? No. No one but the most liberal Zionist or unthinking
                so-called communist would think that. The colonial state will never intentionally destroy itself for the
                benefit of the colonized. Israel will be defeated from without. The Palestinians will be the ones to
                dismantle the walls of apartheid, empty the Israeli torture dungeons, and deliver justice to the
                people.<br><br>

                Why then do you believe Americans will revolt against America? Why do you still believe that Americans
                have class solidarity with the workers of the world?<br><br>

                As Israel uses Palestinian workers as an expendable surplus army or labor, so does America use Mexican
                workers. As Israel imports foreign workers under precarious conditions and deports them when they are
                no longer needed, so does America. Israel bombs it's neighbors, America bombs the world. Israel steals
                Palestinian land, America steals American Indian (and now Greenland Native) land. As Israel keeps 2
                million Palestinians inside Israel as cheap domestic labor, so does America keeps millions of African,
                Native Indian, Mexicano/Chicano, and Asian people inside its borders for the same purpose.<br><br>

                What is murky and unclear in America become clear when studied in Israel. It is obvious to all that
                there are no good political parties in Israel due to the nature of Israel as an apartheid
                ethno-supremacist colonial state. Why then would anyone think that there could be a good political party
                in this apartheid ethno-supremacist colonial state?<br><br>

                The one state solution is already the reality in Palestine. Israeli Occupation Forces control both
                Israel and the West Bank and have annihilated Gaza. The Palestinian Authority is a colonial
                administration run by compradors. Gaza is propped up as an threat for the purposes of legitimizing its
                destruction and looting. Therefore we can say that Mexico and the rest of the Latin America and the
                Caribbean is the US's West Bank and Gaza. Bombed, colonially administered, and plundered for resources
                and cheap and expendable labor.<br><br>

                The solution is for Palestine to defeat Israel, and for Palestine's global south allies to support it.
                Therefore our solution is for Latin America to defeat the US and for their global south allies to
                support them.<br><br>

                What then is the place of sympathetic Americans in this global revolution?<br>
                What is the place of sympathetic Israelis in the Palestinian revolution?<br><br>

                What then is the place of internally colonized Americans in this global revolution?<br>
                What is the place of Palestinians living in Israel in the Palestinian revolution?<br><br>

                I'll leave those questions to your imagination.
