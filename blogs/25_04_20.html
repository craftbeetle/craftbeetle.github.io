            <h2 id="blog_25_04_20">Unpaid Domestic Labor</h2>
            <div class="blog-header">
                <span class="date">25.04.20</span>
                <a class="back-to-blogs" href="/blog.html" target="_self">BACK TO BLOGS</a>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                All labor should be collectivized. This includes domestic labor. Sounds radical but hear me out (and
                I'm not the first to think of this by a long shot):
            </p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>

            <p>
                We currently live in a time where it is generally accepted that there is work done outside for
                money, and there is work done at home because it has to be done. One is paid, one is unpaid. In the
                current capitalist formulation, men do a larger proportion of the paid labor, and women do a
                larger proportion of the unpaid labor. It can be more or less evenly distributed based on time,
                place, context, culture, etc...
            </p>

            <h3>What Should We Do About It</h3>

            <p>
                As a society, we should transform all unpaid individual domestic labor into paid collective labor.
                Sounds extreme and unfeasible at first but consider that we have already done so with so many
                forms of labor. In fact, I argue that all labor use to be unpaid domestic labor performed individually
                or collectively.
            </p>

            <h3>Examples of Previously Collectivized Labor</h3>

            <li>People use to garden for food, we turned that into commercial agriculture.</li>
            <li>People use to make their own clothes, we turned that into the textiles industry.</li>
            <li>People use to cook their own food, teach their own kids, treat their own wounds, we turned those
                into restaurants, schools, and hospitals.</li>

            <p>
                In fact, all domestic labor currently performed also simultaneously exists in its collective paid
                form elsewhere. If you've ever stayed at a hotel then you have experienced it. Your room was
                cleaned, you laundry was washed, your breakfast was made, your car was parked.
            </p>

            <h3>The Benefits of Paid Collectivized Labor</h3>

            <p>
                The benefits of this collective paid labor are numerous. For starters, you don't have to do any of
                that labor yourself, which frees your time and energy for other things. And secondly, the person
                doing that labor does it regularly and thus is not only far more efficient, they are also better
                equipped and can benefit from the division of labor and the economy of scale. Thirdly, this system
                is a far more efficient use of resources which protects ecology as well as reduces the amount of
                labor required to maintain the system.
            </p>

            <h3>Resource and Time Improvements</h3>

            <p>
                You and each person in your neighborhood each own a vacuum, a hammer, a washing machine, a lawn mower,
                a plastic bottle of window cleaning fluid, and so on. Each of these items gets used for a few hours
                per month, yet they each required so much labor to create. And when they need maintenance or
                replacement, those who would do that labor must travel from house to house or you must come to them.
                More likely you'll be throwing the item away and buying a new one. How wasteful.<br /><br />
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, in the hotel, one maintenance team with one set of tools services many room far more
                efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3>Who stands to gain? Who stands to lose?</h3>

            All workers benefit from collective paid labor. Under the current system of labor division,
            those who are paid for their labor have more power than those who are not. Money is power because
            money is the ability to get what you want. With money you can buy food, shelter, healthcare,
            transportation, etc... If one person has money and the other does not, then the person without money
            must obey those that have it in order to gain access to those resources and services. This is the
            case between the boss and the worker, the master and the slave, the paid commercial laborer and the
            unpaid domestic laborer.<br /><br />

            By abolishing this unfair distinction between what is paid labor and what is unpaid labor (which
            often falls along gendered and racialized lines), we further improve fairness in society.<br /><br />

            We all gain, the capitalist is the only one to lose. The capitalist loses what was never theirs to
            begin with, they are punished by having to live as equals with the rest of the world.

            <h3>Examples:</h3>

            <li>Jim works at a restaurant. He earns 200 dollars over 8 hours of labor, cooking to feed many
                people.</li>
            <li>Maya works as a house cleaner. She earns 180 dollars over 8 hours of labor, cleaning the homes of
                many people.</li>
            <li>Mahmood works as a kindergarten teacher. He makes 170 dollars over 8 hours of labor, teaching and
                caring for many young children.</li><br />

            <li>Alex is a stay at home parent. They earn 0 dollars over 8 hours of labor, cooking, cleaning,
                teaching, and caring for their children.</li>
            <li>Jessie works as a driver. They earn 190 dollars a day for 8 hours of labor, driving many people.
                They then come home and earn 0 dollars over 8 hours of labor, caring for a disabled family
                member.</li>

            <h3>Who's to Blame?</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Patriarchy?</strong><br />Patriarchy plays a role in determining who stays home to perform
                unpaid labor, but it doesn't fully explain why that unpaid labor is done in the first place.<br /><br />

                <strong>Racism?</strong><br /> This also plays a role in determining who has access to resources and who
                must labor unpaid, but again it does not fully explain the unpaid labor itself.<br /><br />

                <strong>Capitalism?</strong><br /> This is the root cause of unpaid labor in the current system.
                Exploitation of labor, the stratification of what is and is not worthy of payment and how much payment.
                You see, capitalism requires exploitation. It requires underpaid and unpaid labor for it to be able to
                extract profits. For those profits ARE the money that should have been paid to the underpaid and the
                unpaid. Profits are money taken by those who do nothing. In a fair society there is no profit, because
                there is no exploitation. There is still pay, just not profit.<br />
            </p>

            <h3>How Capitalism Causes the Problem</h3>

            <p>
                If you are an underpaid laborer, a man working in a steel mill for example. You may feel the urge to
                revolt, to demand more, to demand what is rightfully yours. Communists all over the world have done
                so to great success many times. But there is an alternative path the capitalists would rather you go
                down, fascism, racism, sexism, etc... The artificial creation of an underclass of even more
                exploited people who will subsidize your existence. In return, you will keep them down.<br /><br />

                The underpaid man in the steel mill can join forces with the women of the textile mill, and the
                black slaves in the fields, and all the rest of the variably exploited people and demand fairness
                for all.<br /><br />

                Or, they can force women to also work at home, unpaid. To force black people to labor for less or
                nothing. To maintain this layered system of oppression through systemic racism (Jim Crow, Red
                Lining, Police Brutality, Israeli/South African Apartheid, etc...), systemic sexism ("Women belong
                pregnant, barefoot, in the kitchen", "Women are just more nurturing", "Men evolved to hunt and fight,
                women evolved to raise children and care for the home"). But is it not clear to the man in the steel
                mill that the true benefactor of all of this oppression and exploitation is the capitalist, the owner of
                the steel mill. In making you a subservient oppressor they have simultaneously created an even more
                exploited class of workers and staved off your own revolution.
            </p>

            <h3>Typical Unpaid Labor:</h3>

            <li>Cleaning</li>
            <li>Laundry</li>
            <li>Preparing Food</li>
            <li>Child/Elderly/Disabled Care</li>
            <li>Shopping</li>
            <li>Home Construction/Repairs</li>

            <h3>Doesn't Capitalism Do This?</h3>

            <p>
                As stated above, all labor already exists in a collectivized and paid form, but under capitalism it is
                only accessible for those with enough money and the workers doing that labor are usually the least paid.
                Capitalism, the "free" market, will never be a liberational force specifically because it is an
                exploitative and extractive system.
            </p>

            <h3>What about privacy?</h3>

            <p>
                Same as in a hotel, if you don't want your room cleaned, just tell maintenance not to clean it. No
                one will force you to use any of these collective labor systems. Just as you can cook your own food
                or buy your meals from a restaurant, each service is opt-in. Though you will find that it is much more
                convenient to opt-in, especially under communism, where all people have equal access to these services.
            </p>

            <h3>Isn't Doing Unpaid Domestic Labor a Form of Love?</h3>

            <p>
                Doing any kind of labor can be a show of love. From domestic labor to defensive war. But that love
                ends where coercion begins. It is not love to be forced to do something, because showing love is a
                consequence of choice.
            </p>

            <h3>What Can You Do Now?</h3>

            <p>
                Join or create a local organization rooted in communism and dedicated to the elimination of unpaid
                domestic labor. Then, collectivize your labor:<br />
            </p>
            <li>Cook communally.</li>
            <li>Clean for those who need it.</li>
            <li>Regularly visit the elder members of your community.</li>
            <li>Babysit collectively.</li>
            <li>Fix each other's clothes, tools, bikes, cars, homes.</li>
            <li>Lend each other tools.</li>
            <li>Shop for those who cannot.</li>
            <li>Grow food for yourselves in community gardens.</li>

            <p>
                You'll quickly find that one shopping trip can serve a whole neighborhood. One sewing machine can
                fix everyone's worn clothes. A few hours of cooking can feed many families for days. You'll spend
                less time and money, and you'll build a much stronger community. One that needs no police, requires
                much less assistance to survive, and one that can solve its problems much more efficiently.<br />
