            <h2 id="blog_25_12_19">ABP - Always Be Politiking</h2>
            <div class="blog-header">
                <span class="date">26.01.26</span>
                <a class="back-to-blogs" href="/blog.html" target="_self">BACK TO BLOGS</a>
            </div>
            <p>
                ABP is a name I came up with for something that I do and I'm sure others do as well. Something that I
                want more people to be doing. Every day each person interacts with many others to various degrees.
                Sometimes it's a joke with the cashier at the grocery store, other times it's a lengthy talk with a
                coworker or relative. In the imperial core, the dominant philosophies are Imperialism, Capitalism,
                Settlerism, White Supremacy, Patriarchy, Americanism, etc... But what is really interesting is that
                because the Cold War is over, the US has deemed itself the victor of history and thus has begun to slip
                up in its thought policing of the people. Combined with record low literacy rate and highly siloed media
                consumption, and record high rates of mistrust towards the government and institutions has resulted in a
                mass of people who are ideologically defenseless and politically inert, ideal subjects for Political
                Education. A target rich environment.
            </p>

            <h3>The Field</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine if you will a horizontal axis that will serve as an abstraction of "Good" and "Bad" politics.
                Not Democrat and Republican, not woke or broke, or any specific idea, just abstract "Good" and "Bad".
                Now imagine a vertical axis that will be the abstract concept of intensity from "Weak" to "Strong". We
                now have set for ourselves a playing field. Each person we meet and interact with will necessarily have
                their political positions scattered on this field. Some things they believe will be "Good" but "Weak",
                others "Bad" and "Strong", and every other combination. The points are also interconnected, thus moving
                one will nudge the others.<br><br>

                Moving the points is the goal of ABP. To "Always Be Politiking" is not the end all be all of our
                responsibilities, but it is the minimum and easiest way to prepare the field for more intensive work.
                The goal is to turn just about every interaction we have into a political education opportunity, either
                subtly or overtly.

            <h3>Psy-Ops, Backdoors, Claymores</h3>
            <p>
                With the field set and our goals clear we will looks at the opponent's defenses. Everyone who has lived
                and interacted with people has been subjected to an attempt to change their mind. People resist changing
                their mind for various reasons ranging from ego to their identity being attached to an opinion to
                culture and so on, regardless of the reason, they develop defenses against changing their mind. Each
                personality type has a different style of defense which changes depending on the topic. Some may talk
                freely yet stubbornly refuse to change their mind when the facts are laid out, others may shut down
                conversation all together. Our work is too vast and constant to worry about defeating or disarming
                defenses. What we'll do instead is use the back door.<br><br>

                The most effective way of changing someone's mind is to make it seem as if you haven't changed it at
                all. Lead them in the conversation such that they naturally connect the dots in a favorable way. Your
                guidance must not be noticed. Ask leading questions gently, listen intently, tell them your opinion
                framed as if it were their own.<br><br>

                Instead of a frontal ideological assault we will take the unguarded route in. We will psy-op our
                opponent into thinking their had a novel thought of their own. We want our ideological opponent to have
                no idea that they have changed their mind, and even less idea of who caused them to do so. Seems
                diabolical, and kind of funny too. I admit, it is not the honorable Bushido method of changing minds. We
                are ideological guerrilla, set upon from all sides by fascists, racists, misogynists, imperialist, and
                their running dogs. Our's is the ambush, the hit and run, and the booby trap.
            </p>

            <h3>Conventional Wisdom</h3>
            <p>
                In Amerkkka, the common disagreements are usually framed as religion, politics, and the culture war. In
                reality these are protestant/evangelical Christianity vs atheism, conservative capitalism vs liberal
                capitalism, and total social breakdown vs empty social signaling.<br><br>

                This framing attempts to portray what is in reality a very narrow selection of possible positions as
                being the whole spectrum of possibly. The purpose is to allow the illusion of disagreement while
                actually controlling the possible outcomes and keeping the pendulum oscillating instead of breaking the
                system. The consequences though are that people steeped in those narrow conversations are caught
                completely off guard when presented by positions outside the narrow band. Like new world people to old
                world diseases, they have developed no immunity.<br><br>

                Fortunately for us, as defensive as people are they can only set so many claymores by the door, and
                because of the limited nature of discourse in the west our defenders don't even know about all the
                backdoors. This is why penetration testing is important in both digital security and ideological
                security. I've often had conversations with people about religion for example, and most often they land
                in either the christian or atheist camp and have countless prepared statements and responses to the
                other camp.<br><br>

                When I begin speaking from the Muslim perspective they suddenly find themselves unprepared, their attack
                lines not landing, their defenses pointed in the wrong direction. This is also true about politics.
                Often people expect me to defend Democrats, but when I take the Socialist position and disparage both
                Republic and Democrat war crimes and the capitalist system in general they are wrong-footed. And since
                the cold war's been over for over 30 years they don't even have anti-communist attacks prepared. That
                allows me to open a real conversation which they tend to be more receptive to.<br><br>

                When confronted with Islam, or Communism or rational social behavior there is no inbuilt defenses and
                thus we enter uncharted territory and new opportunity.
            </p>

            <h3>Throw a live grenade in the room and close the door.</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes you find yourself in a room with multiple people. If you're not certain that most people will
                back you up it is not advised to try to change anyone's mind directly. Dog-piles are relentless and will
                leave even the best prepared looking like a dummy. Instead, in these environments your goal is to throw
                a live grenade in the room and close the door to see what happens.<br><br>

                Question a remark. Make a bold revolutionary statement and say nothing else. Mention an obvious but
                often ignored injustice causes people to think. Joke about clear hypocrisy.<br><br>

                Where the enemy has numerical advantage our tactic is to harass. Our desired effect is to cause people
                to encounter a new idea and think about it later. We are softening our targets for one-on-one work
                later.
            </p>

            <h3>Find the weak point and attack it for massive damage.</h3>
            <p>
                Not everyone cares about everything. Everyone has sore points that they are especially receptive
                to.<br><br>

                <b>New parent?</b><br>
                Talk about how childcare in socialist countries was free and inside the workplace so not only did both
                parents resume their work more quickly and with less interruption, they also had more quality time with
                their children. At anytime you could walk over to the day care and see your child, breastfeed, eat lunch
                with them.<br><br>

                <b>Dog lover?</b><br>
                Connect animal welfare to the prison industrial complex. Oh you volunteer at the dog shelter? Do you
                feel like it's a nice place for dogs? No? Why not? Because they are packed in, have very little space to
                move, don't get any human attention, and it's generally an unpleasant and traumatic space? Do you think
                the dog shelter is a good place to rehab a dog so it can reenter society and get adopted? No? Where
                would be a better place? Fostering with a family? Why? Because they interact with people and heal and
                improve their behavior in a loving place? And what about badly behaved dogs? Their behavior gets worse
                in confinement and they teach it to other dogs? So even the badly behaved dogs should be fostered and
                taken care of 1-on-1? Okay so all of that is also true of the prison system.<br><br>

                <b>Religious?</b><br>
                Talk about how Jesus flipped the tables of the money changers and washed the feet of the poor. How Islam
                has a mandatory 2.5% wealth tax (not income tax) which all must go to taking care of the poorest in
                society. How taking care of the needy is what we are commanded to do.
            </p>

            <h3>Steel Folded A Thousand Times</h3>
            <p>
                Repeated ABP efforts on the same people can have cumulative effects, so long as they don't develop an
                immunity. Be persistent but not nagging. Be funny and charismatic. No one wants to be lectured. Also
                have some non-ABP conversations once in a while to cause them to drop their defenses.<br><br>

                The effects of ABP also accumulate in society as the people you talk to will talk to many others. That
                results in system wide effects of improvement, community building, and organization. Or, at the very
                least, weakens our opponent's ideological conditioning by introducing the alternative. If you reach
                someone with the right idea before they hear the wrong, they can even be immunized from that
                lie.<br><br>

                To what end?
                You may now be thinking, why? Why put on all this effort to change people's minds? The answers will
                differ from person to person but here are a few:

                <li>You care deeply about a cause and are seeking more support for it.</li>
                <li>You have a vested interest in an ideology going out of style.</li>
                <li>You want to be surrounded by allies and pacified opponents.</li>
                <li>You are tired of hearing the same old lies and cliches.</li>
                <li>You enjoy mental games and verbal wrestling.</li>
                <li>You want to see a better future.</li>
            </p>
