            <p>
                Reading is a fundamental pillar of my life and the way I was raised. I find that while other forms
                of media have great value and strengths, books remain the best way to delve deeply into a subject. A
                book's demand for exclusive cognitive attention makes gives it the ability to convey more than any
                other medium. My goal is to read 50 books a year, which is about a book a week. Here are my thoughts
                on the books I have read.

                        <strong>The Message</strong><br /><br />
                        Ta-Nehisi Coates was introduced to me through an interview he did with Novara Media where he
                        talked about The Message. I did not read it then, but I did think his observations of apartheid
                        were clear, though I did not need him to tell me that.<br><br>

                        Later on a good friend recommended the book so I listened to the audiobook narrated by Coates
                        himself. There, through his evocative narration I learned about Coates' life, his journey, and
                        his reason for writing The Message. That The Message is a book long correction of an error he
                        has made in invoking Israel a potential model for the reparation to Africans in America as he
                        outlines in The Case For Reparations. In doing so I had learned about his wrong doing through
                        his correction, and I grew to respect him even more for that honestly.<br><br>

                        Certainly a worthwhile read or listen. Ta-Nehisi aims to haunt the reader and listener and
                        succeeds.

                        Heart wrenching. I felt myself fill with anger, and hate, then sadness, and mourning, then
                        determination as I journeyed through this short story. I felt what Said felt, what Safiyya felt,
                        and what Faris felt. Just as I was most strongly needing Said to take his house back, Kanafani
                        gives Faris' story to temper that feeling. Just as I most strongly mourned the past, Said
                        realizes the homeland is the future.

                        <strong>Blackshirts and Reds</strong><br /><br />
                        Parenti lays out a balanced defense of the soviet union in specific and communism in general in
                        Blackshirts and Red, and explains how communism's opponents tear it down and destroy it. Highly
                        informative and ultimately tragic as vast swaths of the global population achieved then lost
                        communism for various reasons from within and without. Parenti is of course a must read for
                        anyone interested in communism and socialism, and for those interested in how capitalists and
                        fascists ruin life for everyone. At the very least, everyone should listen to the Yellow Parenti
                        lecture.

                        An old classic in horror, written in the 1890s and commonly found in The King in Yellow. I
                        really enjoyed this short story. It was incredibly immersive and the images it painted were
                        incredible. Right at the end of the story I realized that I had believed the narrator and only
                        in the last moments did I think back and realize there was no proof for anything they had
                        claimed. Amazing!

                        <strong>Hellstar Remina</strong><br /><br />
                        I don't like horror. All my friends know it, I avoid it as much as possible. Not because it
                        scares me but because it does't interest me.<br /><br />
                        That being said, I am now engaging with it for the purpose of learning it to be able to run a
                        game of Mothership. Hellstar Remina is a work by the renowned horror mangaka, Junji Ito. I heard
                        of him and praise of his work primarily in association with The Enigma of Amigara Fault.
                        Hellstar
                        Remina is beautifully drawn and well written. I can't say that I was moved by it in any way, but
                        it was certainly not a dull read. I found it more funny than scary.

                        This book was lent to me by a very good friend almost as a joke because he gave me the french
                        translation. The book was originally written in italian so there was no reason to read a french
                        translation instead of an english one except for the fact that I could, so I did. The reading
                        was easy but the understanding not so much. I use to be fluent in french but I haven't used it
                        for over a decade, so reading was more a de-rusting than a theoretical learning experience for
                        me. I'll have to read it again in english to really understand it but already I am more
                        comfortable speaking and thinking in french.<br /><br />
                        Either way I had a really fun time with it.

                        so well crafted. There are no chapters, just one long tale and it is so much better for it. This
                        is exactly the kind of story I want read to me in a quiet but emotive voice on a sunset beach.
                        Oddly specific, but read the story and you may have a similar experience of peace and humanity.

                        <strong>The Revolution of 1936-1939 in Palestine</strong><br /><br />
                        Ghassan Kanafani widely known in the west for fiction writing, but his non-fiction political
                        writing is far more well known around the world. The Revolution of 1936-1939 in Palestine is an
                        analysis of the material conditions that lead up to the revolution and a dissection of the
                        causes for the revolution's defeat by the British and Zionist forces. The Revolution's crushing
                        is correctly identified as the precursor to the 1948 Nakba and the events that follow.
                        Kanafani's writing is concise and to the point, he cites all of his sources and evidence for his
                        analysis and lays out a clear view of the events and their impact. During my reading I kept
                        thinking of the parallels in our current time and place and how we can avoid the pitfalls of the
                        past.

                        same themes as The Disposessed while on a different planet with unique circumstances. I liked
                        the story and the ideas it explores. The Dispossessed is still my more favorite of the two.

                        No wonder Obama had him assassinated, Gaddafi had some really good ideas. Did I agree with every
                        single idea and statement in the book? Maybe not. But his overall political, economic, and
                        social theory are sound.

                        First of all, the magic system in this world is really cool. It's what you would get if you
                        could quantum entangle whole objects or processes instead of particles. The magic feels and is
                        treated like a science. I enjoyed Kvothe's escapades with the troupe, in the city, and in the
                        university. Though he is a boy wonder he still doesn't solve all of his problems easily, far
                        from it. The one bit I did not enjoy, and it was an overly long bit being as it was most of the
                        last third of the book was the romance. I just was not interested in all of that, didn't find it
                        compelling. It's not that it comes out of left field either, the book telegraphs this all
                        through out, from the songs of mythical ancient lovers to the characters themselves saying it
                        straight up in the very beginning of the book. What I did not expect was how much time was spent
                        focusing on the details of teenage romance. The book is still great. I don't think I'll be
                        reading the second in the series though because it seems like the third and final book will not
                        be coming out any time soon and I just don't need another cliffhanger in my life.

                        <strong>The First Time Manager</strong><br /><br />
                        This book is surprisingly good. It was another assigned reading for my job. I found it very
                        clear and informative on the practical skills of management. Of course managerialism is never
                        the goal, but we do exist in a capitalist society as of now and so we might as well understand
                        how to navigate it. It is structured as a manual and so whenever there is a need, one can easily
                        flip to the relevant section and read the author's advice. That advice is generally what you
                        would get from a more senior competent manager. Worth reading if you are a manager or work with
                        them, will give you insight into the machine.

                        <strong>The Servant</strong><br /><br />
                        The Servant is a book about leadership which attempt to change old corporate habits from old
                        school management to a more progressive leadership. It was assigned reading and it wasn't
                        horrible. Well written for what it is and generally inoffensive, except for the anti-union bits.
                        The target audience are middle to upper-middle class managerial liberals, so obviously a
                        material analysis of work place conditions, or the idea of self governed democratic labor was
                        out of the question. Instead we get paternal pseudo-religious platitudes.

                        <strong>A Dying Colonialism</strong><br /><br />
                        As I read about the Algerian fight for liberation I gained a deeper understanding of French
                        Islamophobia. In the course of their colonialism they had a concerted effort to remove the
                        Algerian women's hijab as a way of westernizing them and asserting cultural dominance. What they
                        instead got was those women resisting even harder and using the hijab as a weapon against
                        oppression, by either hiding their identity as they conducted resistance actions or by removing
                        their hijab thus tricking the french into believing that had won her over and lowering their
                        guard against her. Now the french continue to ban the hijab as a vindictive act against their
                        former colonial subjects.<br /><br />
                        The french attempted to destroy the Algerian understanding of family and culture yet found that
                        the Algerian people, after a moment of disoriented despair and withdrawal, returned with a
                        righteous might. Once the Algerian people decided they wanted to be free, there was no stopping
                        them, and rightfully so. Even a cursory search of French atrocities in Algeria is enough to make
                        anyone with a consistence resist them. For example, between 8 May – 26 June 1945 the french
                        massacred up to 45,000 Algerians in the cities of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9tif_and_Guelma_massacre" target="_blank">Sétif and
                            Guelma</a>.<br /><br />
                        As with all colonial resistance, the oppressors are fortunate that the oppressed do not seek
                        revenge, simply freedom and justice. All those who wanted to join the liberation struggle, be
                        they Muslim Algerian, Jewish Algerian, or Western Algerian were allowed to fully participate and
                        were welcome to remain in the newly liberated Algeria as equals. This is the faith of all
                        colonial endeavors, no matter how advanced they may seem. I am now interested in learning about
                        the Moroccan revolution against the French and the Spanish.

                        <strong>Ishmael</strong><br /><br />
                        My whole experience with Ishmael was wonderful. It started off with a conversation with great
                        friend about this, that or the other. She then told me she brought something for me and produced
                        an old copy of Ishmael, bought from a thrift store some time ago, her bookmark still in it. I
                        was so touched by the gift that I hungry read the book in a few days. The paper was yellowed
                        with time, the cellulose broken down into a sweet sent.
                        <br /><br />
                        Ishmael teaches the main character, and in doing so teaches the reader, that the world is not
                        made for humans, but that humans were made for it. That when people see the world as theirs,
                        they inherently seek to conquer and invariably destroy it. And while I disagree on the
                        theological points, I do agree that humanity should seek to better live in the world, alongside
                        all of creation, than to dominate and annihilate it.
                        <br /><br />
                        In the spirit of being gifted the book, I then passed it along to my parents. And after they
                        finish it I'll give it to a friend, so that all may read what Ishmael has to teach.

                        <strong>Value, Price and Profit</strong><br /><br />
                        Marx makes the relationship of value, price, and profit very clear. We often still hear about
                        how increasing wages would increase the price of goods and services but in reality that is not
                        the case. It simply reduces profits for the bourgeoisie, profits they derive from the unpaid
                        portion of the proletariat's labor.

                        I was already familiar with Real Wages, but I had not thought of Relative Wages which are really
                        the root of the income inequality by definition. As well I have a new appreciation for the gig
                        economy as as the ideal capitalist labor market, where all tasks are fractalized and staccato,
                        disconnecting the laborer from the labor and for each other, opening the door for infinite
                        scabs.

                        I met Ihmayed Ali and his daughter at a Palestinian book talk where they shared about their
                        lives and experiences as Palestinian refugees. The talk was moving and eye opening. I then
                        bought and read his book and was blown away by the images he shared. Ihmayed's autobiography is
                        written in a very vivid and honest way. The things he goes through, the oppression and abuse,
                        the survival and success. His story is representative of large portions of the Palestinian
                        population, a people who endure despite incredible hardship. I highly recommend this book to
                        anyone seeking a personal look at the Palestinian story.

                        This book is absolutely massive. Melville clearly loves and knows much about whaling and he
                        wants to share it all and it takes 600 pages to do so. I didn't love the book in all honesty but
                        I do respect it. It is one of the oldest books I've read and had it come out in recent decades
                        someone would have made him cut it down but I'm glad it exists in its entirety. A book about
                        whales ought to be massive. I wouldn't recommend most people read it but the audiobook by
                        William Hootkins is very good. I switch to it about half way through reading my physical copy.

                        In Strong Towns, Charles explains the way in which cities use to be built gradually and how that
                        has changed into an unsustainable model of growth. He makes points about how single family homes
                        are subsidized by downtown businesses, and about the debt cities find themselves with when they
                        try to make themselves attractive to developments. What Charles fails to do is question the
                        underlying economic system, and is instead content on working within capitalism. This is not
                        surprising and he identifies as a conservative.

                        for what it means to be a man. The way Harper Lee describes Atticus's interactions with his
                        children and his community and the high regard in which they hold him shows what a man of
                        integrity is, and shoots dead the idea that people in the past were simply a product of their
                        time. A wonderful read and a pretty good <a

                        a great job of constructing a believable society with all of its struggles and beauty. Even if
                        this isn't the exact way I imagine an ideal world, I find inspiration and hope in the refutation
                        of the status quo as all that there ever could be. If this is a plausible formulation of

                        well an increasingly moody human AI, and neo-humans. What's left? Why it's psychically linked
                        corvids and a twist so good I won't even explain. Unlike the other two books, this one is a real
                        mental trip. Elder race is linear but jumps perspectives. The Children of Time has a spider past
                        and human present timeline it jumps between. And the Children of Ruin has two pasts, one on each
                        planet, and a present. This book has a looping, recursive, bleeding timeline. As if you wrote
                        the events of the story on a stack of paper and it got wet, words from one time transferring to
                        another. It won't make total sense until it all makes sense in the end. Definitely worth a read.

                        Written with the intent of being adapted into a film, 2001 A Space Odyssey is mostly vibes and
                        aesthetics. I had vivid images of the stations, space ships, and the cosmos. I hadn't watched
                        <a href="films.html#2001_a_space_odyssey_film_review">the film</a> until after I read the book
                        so I found the book quite enjoyable.

                        <strong>Children of Ruin</strong><br /><br />
                        So jumping spiders, ancient human AI, and neo-humans weren't enough? Now you want octopus and
                        truly alien life? Okay! The second book in the Children of Series explores another set of
                        worlds with new life forms and the way they developed. I am personally very fond of the octopus,
                        I identify with and strive to argue like they do. They give it their all, use their logic and
                        emotion, then, if they are truly convinced, they go all in and spread the message as if it were
                        their own. The trick to this method is balance, you have to be sufficiently hard headed that
                        only the best ideas with the best evidence can convince you, but you also have to be
                        sufficiently sincere that once convinced you become a beacon of that idea. If the octopus's
                        motive force is expression, then the other alien's motive is experience. The other alien seeks
                        novelty at all costs, but in doing so is apt to destroy what it loves. There is much to learn
                        from both creatures, and of forgiveness. Another banger from Tchaikovsky.

                        A neat view into the origins of the Punisher. One can easily see how plausible this course of

                        violence is justified. A valuable window into cop culture.

                        I don't think it's possible to read this book and not fall in love with jumping spiders, and
                        don't get me started on Dr. Avarna Kern. Tchaikovsky has a gift for perspective. He has the
                        ability to turn his mind into a blank slate, throw away our human preconceptions, and start a
                        new from an alien perspective. How would a spiders build a society? How would they react if we
                        suddenly wanted to take their planet? How would one of humanity's brightest minds deal with
                        isolation and a fundamental change in cognitive ability? All beautifully explored question in
                        this book and much more.

                        What can I say about 1984 that hadn't been said already? I originally decided to read this book
                        so that I could confidently say "I read 1984". I only half joke. But as I got into the book I
                        discovered what all the hype was about. It wasn't mind blowing but I also read it in a post 1984
                        world which has for nearly 80 years been deeply affected by it. My most appreciated part of the
                        book is how long ago it was written and how it remains relevant today.

                        Solaris was originally written in Russian and the translation is of disputed quality. This
                        matters particularly because this book, while set on an alien planet, occurs mainly in the
                        thoughts of the main character. I enjoyed the explorations of sentience and cognition, and the
                        soft dreamlike horror that builds up.

                        I was in the mall book store with a friend just killing time when the cover of this book caught
                        my eye. I knew nothing of Tchaikovsky at the time so I had no idea that this was a soft sequel
                        to his Children of Series. I read the first few pages in that book store and immediately loved
                        it. I bought it on mid day Saturday, and by Sunday I had finished it. That's not a testament to
                        my reading speed so much as it is of the books quality. The dual language concept and the
                        science as magic concept were so good that I needed to know what else he had written, and a few
                        days later the Children of Series arrived at my doorstep.

                        Right as the Cyberpunk 2077 conversation was warming up, and after watching Action Button's 8
                        hour review (yes, in one sitting), I was still unwilling to give the game a chance. But, what I
                        getting really interested in was science fiction and cyberpunk. I decided to pick this book up
                        and I was not disappointed. One of the seminal works in the cyberpunk genre, and the origin of
                        the term "metaverse", it paints a funny version of the cyberpunk dystopia we've come to expect.
                        Yes, the killing, poverty, and misery are all there as substrate for the tech megacorps to
                        exploit. But the characters and narration lift the mood and focuses on the fun. Easily
                        recommended.

                        I was recommended this book by a friend. They described it as "The Other 1984". I see the
                        similarities but the themes not the same. The most striking aspect of the book is how normal
                        creating people for specific roles is, and how the few intellectual elites are still bound up in
                        the odd society they are a part of.

                        <strong>Dune</strong><br /><br />
                        Dune is science fiction at its finest: an exploration of real human life, relationships,
                        politics, material conditions, religion, etc all through a medium fictionalized enough to drop
                        your guard. That's what makes the best science fiction, the abstracted layer that allows us to
                        explore reality in play. You may not want to talk about the invasion of the Iraq but you do want
                        to talk about Arrakis. Imperialism and colonialism for the sake of resources such as oil, gas,
                        and mineral? No. Spice and water? Yes. There is a component of the white savior, inspired by
                        Lawrence of Arabia, and there is an analog Sufi Islam rather than the approximately 90% Sunni
                        reality, but it works. My favorite part of reading Dune was the use of Arabic as the "mystical"
                        language instead of the usual Latin or a fictional language. As an Arabic speaker I had a
                        slightly different reading experience than the non-Arabic speaker in that I got hints far in
                        advance of where the plot was going. All in all Dune is an incredible book. I read it a few
                        years before the <a href="films.html#dune_part_one_film_review">first</a> and <a

                        <strong>Pathfinder</strong><br /><br />
                        I remember Pathfinder as being a great science fiction novel that had a fun twist with
                        space-time travel and time loops. My dad also liked and ended reading the whole series which is
                        something I really should do, that and read the Ender's game series in full.

                        <strong>Ender's Game</strong><br /><br />
                        I read Ender's Game a long time ago in elementary school and I still remember it well. Card
                        paints a fascinating picture of a fascist future fighting aliens and the consequences thereof. I
                        won't spoil the ending but I will say that this book really clicked with a really young me.

                        <strong>The Law of Ueki</strong><br /><br />
                        The Law of Ueki was one of the first manga I ever read and I read it before watching any anime
                        so it essentially set a tone, a standard in my mind. Little did I know it was subverting many of
                        the tropes of anime and manga by making the main characters whole ambition to simply protect the
                        environment and be good to the people around him. Ueki couldn't care less about beating others,
                        getting power, or even looking cool. All Ueki wants is for trees to grow, the air to be clean,
                        and the people to be safe and happy. And that resonated with me. He's not shy to fight when
                        necessary but he doesn't relish in it, doesn't make it his primary ambition. Ueki loves life.

                        <strong>The Legend of Zelda - Major's Mask Manga</strong><br /><br />
                        This is a neat adaptation of Majora's Mask into a manga. I think adapting relatively linear
                        video games may be the easiest type of adaptation to pull off and pull it off they did. While I
                        haven't actually played Majora's Mask I have watched my fair share of walkthroughs, analysis,
                        and speedruns. The manga was pretty darn good.
