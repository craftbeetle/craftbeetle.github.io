                Passive consumption is their aim for us. They seek to make us drones of capital, laboring, and being
                pacified with treats and controlled opposition. The 2 minutes of hate as Orwell put it. Even
                revolutionary seeming media is still designed to be a surrogate for real action. We want a movie
                about some rebels and we relate to the rebels. In doing so we think that we have somehow struck at
                the empire. This feeling acts as a release of our feelings and a pacification.

                To affect real change you have to get up and do something. Go outside and meet your neighbors. Feed
                those who don't have food. Attend book talks, protests, and fundraisers. Connect with the people and
                build that lasting change you want to see.
