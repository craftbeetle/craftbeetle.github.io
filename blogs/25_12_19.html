                For as long as capitalism has existed, there have been workers and owners. This is a simplification of
                class reality that will suffice for this analysis. The workers produce, and the owners control the means
                of production to extract profits from the alienated labor of the workers. Therefor, the workers and the
                owners at in an antagonistic relationship, where one gains the other loses and the reverse is true. This
                is the primary contradiction of capitalism.<br><br>

                Contradictions must be resolved.<br><br>

                One possible resolution is that the workers overthrow the owners and take control of the means of
                production. This is a stable resolution because the owners are a non-essential parasite, they only
                extract and do not contribute to production. In this resolution the owner class is destroyed, and all
                surviving owners become workers. With only one class remaining, the contraction is resolved.<br><br>

                The owners naturally do not want their class destroyed, but they also understand that their class is
                non-essential and the worker class is essential. There is no resolution in which the owners are the only
                remaining class and the workers are eliminated because without the workers, nothing gets done.<br><br>

                Or so we think.<br><br>

                The owner class necessarily has class consciousness because their class is the one that can be
                destroyed. The worker class can only be subdued, its efforts momentarily thwarted, it's revolution
                delayed. This reality gives the owners existential anxiety and so their seek an alternate resolution to
                the contradiction. What if the workers were not necessary?<br><br>

                Automation is the owner class's answer to the essential role of the worker class. To replace worker
                muscle with steel and the replace worker mind with silicone. This is the fundamental reason for the
                rapid and mass development and adoption of robotics and AI. The goal is to make the working class
                obsolete in pursuit of making the owner class viable on it's own.<br><br>

                This then poses a question. Let us imagine that the robots and AIs get so good as to finally make
                obsolete all labor. What happens to the workers? Idealistic and naive liberals imagine a future of mass
                leisure, creative endeavors, and universal basic income or the abolition of money all together in a
                world of hyper abundance. To what end? For what reason? Altruism? No.<br><br>

                Obsolete workers are eliminated. The owner class currently lives on massive estates far from the rest of
                humanity, look down on everyone not exactly like them, and seek to control everything. Anyone who
                opposes them, demands self determination and divinity in life with be dealt with as the American
                Indians, Palestinians, South Africans, Aboriginals of Australia, and countless others. As automation and
                AI progress and improve, larger and larger portions of the global population will become unnecessary
                surplus. As automated weapons improve and increase in number, more and more peoples will be annihilated,
                their land turned into nature reserves and mansion estates. The fully automated future is a planet with
                a population of a few thousand dancing on our billions of graves.<br><br>
