            <p>
                This website has been a lot of fun so far. I have enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
                the creative process of designing a user experience. The most rewarding part has been the feedback I
                get from my friends after they visit my site and learn about the things I make, the plants and
                animals I see, and my thoughts on the media I enjoy.<br /><br />

                It started out very simple and I have successfully kept it consistent and easy to manage. The
                content is easy to post and update and the organization and feel of the site has matured over
                time.<br /><br />

                Now that the site is stabilized and matured, I think it would be interesting to experiment some
                more. I have fallen into a pattern, which has been immensely helpful in keeping me on track, but now
                I want to try new things. I also want to break out of the idea that all content has to be perfect
                before I post it. As I have thought, written, and created more, I have realized that the old adage
                that "Perfect is the enemy of good." is true here as well. Why hold back on writing my thought on a
                thing just because I don't think I'll perfectly express everything I want to express? These are the
                inhibitions of the big social media platforms, where creation is product, not art.<br /><br />

                In short I will try to be a bit more organic and less inhibited in this site. This has never been a
                professional product to be sold, so I shouldn't treat it as such. It's my personal website and I
                invite you to continue enjoying it, flaws and all.<br /><br />
