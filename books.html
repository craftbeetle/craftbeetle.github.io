                <p>
                    Reading is a fundamental pillar of my life and the way I was raised. I find that while other forms
                    of media have great value and strengths, books remain the best way to delve deeply into a subject. A
                    book's demand for exclusive cognitive attention makes gives it the ability to convey more than any
                    other medium. My goal is to read 50 books a year, which is about a book a week. Here are my thoughts
                    on the books I have read.
                </p>

                        Reading...

                    <p>
                        <strong>Ishmael</strong><br /><br />
                        My whole experience with Ishmael was wonderful. It started off with a conversation with great 
                        friend about this, that or the other. She then told me she brought something for me and produced 
                        an old copy of Ishmael, bought from a thrift store some time ago, her bookmark still in it. I was 
                        so touched by the gift that I hungry read the book in a few days. The paper was yellowed with time, 
                        the cellulose broken down into a sweet sent.
                        <br /><br />
                        Ishmael teaches the main character, and in doing so teaches the reader, that the world is not 
                        made for humans, but that humans were made for it. That when people see the world as theirs, 
                        they inherently seek to conquer and invariably destroy it. And while I disagree on the theological 
                        points, I do agree that humanity should seek to better live in the world, alongside all of creation, 
                        than to dominate and annihilate it.
                        <br /><br />
                        In the spirit of being gifted the book, I then passed it along to my parents. And after they 
                        finish it I'll give it to a friend, so that all may read what Ishmael has to teach.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can't escape the cage if you can't find the bars.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Value, Price and Profit</strong><br /><br />
                        Marx makes the relationship of value, price, and profit very clear. We often still hear about
                        how increasing wages would increase the price of goods and services but in reality that is not
                        the case. It simply reduces profits for the bourgeoisie, profits they derive from the unpaid
                        portion of the proletariat's labor.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Wage-Labour and Capital</strong><br /><br />
                        I was already familiar with Real Wages, but I had not thought of Relative Wages which are really
                        the root of the income inequality by definition. As well I have a new appreciation for the gig
                        economy as as the ideal capitalist labor market, where all tasks are fractalized and staccato,
                        disconnecting the laborer from the labor and for each other, opening the door for infinite
                        scabs.

                        <strong>Abandoned Palestine Refugee</strong><br /><br />
                        I met Ihmayed Ali and his daughter at a Palestinian book talk where they shared about their
                        lives and experiences as Palestinian refugees. The talk was moving and eye opening. I then
                        bought and read his book and was blown away by the images he shared. Ihmayed's autobiography is
                        written in a very vivid and honest way. The things he goes through, the oppression and abuse,
                        the survival and success. His story is representative of large portions of the Palestinian
                        population, a people who endure despite incredible hardship. I highly recommend this book to
                        anyone seeking a personal look at the Palestinian story.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Moby Dick</strong><br /><br />
                        This book is absolutely massive. Melville clearly loves and knows much about whaling and he
                        wants to share it all and it takes 600 pages to do so. I didn't love the book in all honesty but
                        I do respect it. It is one of the oldest books I've read and had it come out in recent decades
                        someone would have made him cut it down but I'm glad it exists in its entirety. A book about
                        whales ought to be massive. I wouldn't recommend most people read it but the audiobook by
                        William Hootkins is very good. I switch to it about half way through reading my physical copy.

                        <strong>Principles of Communism</strong><br /><br />
                        An easy introduction into communist theory. This is absolutely a must read that lays out
                        communism for the layman. I found it put already known and understood concepts into a new
                        perspective, shed a light on some connection previously missed.

                        <strong>Strong Towns</strong><br /><br />
                        In Strong Towns, Charles explains the way in which cities use to be built gradually and how that
                        has changed into an unsustainable model of growth. He makes points about how single family homes
                        are subsidized by downtown businesses, and about the debt cities find themselves with when they
                        try to make themselves attractive to developments. What Charles fails to do is question the
                        underlying economic system, and is instead content on working within capitalism. This is not
                        surprising and he identifies as a conservative.

                        <strong>To Kill A Mockingbird</strong><br /><br />
                        If ever there was a manual on how to be a good father, this would be a contender. This also goes
                        for what it means to be a man. The way Harper Lee describes Atticus's interactions with his
                        children and his community and the high regard in which they hold him shows what a man of
                        integrity is, and shoots dead the idea that people in the past were simply a product of their
                        time. A wonderful read and a pretty good movie.

                        <strong>The Dispossessed</strong><br /><br />
                        A beautiful book that explores one possible way that anarcho-communism could exist. Le Guin does
                        a great job of constructing a believable society with all of its struggles and beauty. Even if
                        this isn't the exact way I imagine an ideal world, I find inspiration and hope in the refutation
                        of the status quo as all that there ever could be. If this is a plausible formulation of
                        society, what else is possible? A worthwhile and captivating read.

                        <strong>Children of Memory</strong><br /><br />
                        So far we've had spiders, octopus, true aliens (insert "Nano Machines, Son!" audio sting), as
                        well an increasingly moody human AI, and neo-humans. What's left? Why it's psychically linked
                        corvids and a twist so good I won't even explain. Unlike the other two books, this one is a real
                        mental trip. Elder race is linear but jumps perspectives. The Children of Time has a spider past
                        and human present timeline it jumps between. And the Children of Ruin has two pasts, one on each
                        planet, and a present. This book has a looping, recursive, bleeding timeline. As if you wrote
                        the events of the story on a stack of paper and it got wet, words from one time transferring to
                        another. It won't make total sense until it all makes sense in the end. Definitely worth a read.

                        Written with the intent of being adapted into a film, 2001 A Space Odyssey is mostly vibes and
                        aesthetics. I had vivid images of the stations, space ships, and the cosmos. I hadn't watched the
                        film until after I read the book and I found it quite enjoyable. You can read my thoughts on the

                        truly alien life? Okay! The second book in the Children of Series explores another set of
                        worlds with new life forms and the way they developed. I am personally very fond of the octopus,
                        I identify with and strive to argue like they do. They give it their all, use their logic and
                        emotion, then, if they are truly convinced, they go all in and spread the message as if it were
                        their own. The trick to this method is balance, you have to be sufficiently hard headed that
                        only the best ideas with the best evidence can convince you, but you also have to be
                        sufficiently sincere that once convinced you become a beacon of that idea. If the octopus's
                        motive force is expression, then the other alien's motive is experience. The other alien seeks
                        novelty at all costs, but in doing so is apt to destroy what it loves. There is much to learn
                        from both creatures, and of forgiveness. Another banger from Tchaikovsky.

                        A neat view into the origins of the Punisher. One can easily see how plausible this course of
                        character development is and how it leads to one to believe that they are the law and that their
                        violence is justified. A valuable window into cop culture.

                        Head Lopper achieved exactly what it set out to do. It was beautiful and entertaining. At no
                        point do you feel the head lopper could fail, and that's okay. I enjoyed reading the printed
                        trade in one quiet summer night. I may read the other entries in the series in the future.

                        I don't think it's possible to read this book and not fall in love with jumping spiders, and
                        don't get me started on Dr. Avarna Kern. Tchaikovsky has a gift for perspective. He has the
                        ability to turn his mind into a blank slate, throw away our human preconceptions, and start a
                        new from an alien perspective. How would a spiders build a society? How would they react if we
                        suddenly wanted to take their planet? How would one of humanity's brightest minds deal with
                        isolation and a fundamental change in cognitive ability? All beautifully explored question in
                        this book and much more.

                        <strong>1984</strong><br /><br />
                        What can I say about 1984 that hadn't been said already? I originally decided to read this book
                        so that I could confidently say "I read 1984". I only half joke. But as I got into the book I
                        discovered what all the hype was about. It wasn't mind blowing but I also read it in a post 1984
                        world which has for nearly 80 years been deeply affected by it. My most appreciated part of the
                        book is how long ago it was written and how it remains relevant today.

                        <strong>Solaris</strong><br /><br />
                        Solaris was originally written in Russian and the translation is of disputed quality. This
                        matters particularly because this book, while set on an alien planet, occurs mainly in the
                        thoughts of the main character. I enjoyed the explorations of sentience and cognition, and the
                        soft dreamlike horror that builds up.

                        I was in the mall book store with a friend just killing time when the cover of this book caught
                        my eye. I knew nothing of Tchaikovsky at the time so I had no idea that this was a soft sequel
                        to his Children of Series. I read the first few pages in that book store and immediately loved
                        it. I bought it on mid day Saturday, and by Sunday I had finished it. That's not a testament to
                        my reading speed so much as it is of the books quality. The dual language concept and the
                        science as magic concept were so good that I needed to know what else he had written, and a few
                        days later the Children of Series arrived at my doorstep.

                        Driver (the Korean film) gave me. The world needs more Spider Jerusalem's that do true honest
                        journalism at all costs and by all means necessary.

                        Right as the Cyberpunk 2077 conversation was warming up, and after watching Action Button's 8
                        hour review (yes, in one sitting), I was still unwilling to give the game a chance. But, what I
                        getting really interested in was science fiction and cyberpunk. I decided to pick this book up
                        and I was not disappointed. One of the seminal works in the cyberpunk genre, and the origin of
                        the term "metaverse", it paints a funny version of the cyberpunk dystopia we've come to expect.
                        Yes, the killing, poverty, and misery are all there as substrate for the tech megacorps to
                        exploit. But the characters and narration lift the mood and focuses on the fun. Easily
                        recommended.

                        I was recommended this book by a friend. They described it as "The Other 1984". I see the
                        similarities but the themes not the same. The most striking aspect of the book is how normal
                        creating people for specific roles is, and how the few intellectual elites are still bound up in
                        the odd society they are a part of.
