                Humans have had their Neural Networks trained over hundreds of thousands of years. Our brains
                already have all the pathways and connections necessary to process and generate visual, auditory,
                linguistic, and other types of information. When a human is born, they are not beginning their
                training but instead are simply fine-tuning an ancient model for new languages, art forms, and
                ideas.<br /><br />

                Generative AI on the other hand does not have this benefit. It requires massive amounts of high
                quality data to train. It also has the critical pitfall of not being able to train on its own
                outputs because it isn't the center of its own existence. Humans can train on human material because
                we live for ourselves. AI exists for our benefit, we aren't interested in what the AI thinks, we
                want it to emulate what we think.<br /><br />

                So an problem is created when we use AI to generate, then post those generation back to the
                internet, which then goes back into the AI. Soon, the AI will develop the computational equivalent
                of prion disease. And the stakeholders of AI companies know this. How then will they get around this
                issue?<br /><br />

                One possible solution for them to access fresh, high quality data is by harvesting it right at the
                source. No longer relying on the intermediary of scrapping the internet, the AI companies will
                instead contract directly with governments, intelligence agencies, data brokers, and communications
                companies to record everything in our lives and use it to train AI. How will this look?<br /><br />

                Expect to see changes to the terms and services of the various software and hardware you use saying
                something like "By using this product, you are consenting to us collecting your information for AI
                training purposes. Don't worry, we pinky promise that it's all anonymous.". You might expect to see
                high speed internet become cheap or even free, so long as the ISP can see what you are doing. You
                might find that your new phone has an always on camera/microphone for "theft protection" or
                "security". Your government ID will become a high resolution 3D scan of your face, security cameras
                will become 8K with film quality microphones, your email will read everything that goes through it,
                all for the purpose of training AI.<br /><br />

                I hope this doesn't come across as fear mongering or conspiracy theory. Worry not dear reader, I do
                believe we landed on the moon, that vaccines do work, and that 5G is just internet. I simply as you
                to read the terms of service of the products you are using. This issue has already been demonstrated
                by <a href="https://youtu.be/EXxMCm941WA" target="_blank">Adobe</a>, and
                <a href="https://youtu.be/JiMXb2NkAxQ?feature=shared" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I'm also not
                anti-AI by default, but I do agree with many arguments against its training and use. I write this
                website myself, without the use of generative AI for my writing or images. If you see it or read it
                here, it's "real". If I ever do use AI in a project in the future, it will be made very clear.
