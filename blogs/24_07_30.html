            </div>

            <p>
                You wake up and find every is wet. At first you don't even know what to do. Maybe you do nothing,
                maybe you do something that helps, maybe you do something makes things worse. Then, for whatever
                reason, you finally decide to call a plumber. <br /><br />

                "Hello plumber, my house is wet."<br /><br />

                "I see, well that is called flooding. It happens when you have a hole in the roof, or a faucet is
                open while a pipe is clogged, or you're in a hurricane."<br /><br />

                So you check open the curtain, no hurricane.<br />

                You check the roof, no hole.<br />

                You check the bathroom, flooded.<br /><br />

                Now what? You try to mopping but it just moves water around. You try to scoop it out but you get
                tired and it gets bad again. You give in and close the faucet. Now the house is still flooded but at
                the very least it's not getting worse. You start scooping water out and it lowers the level in the
                bathroom, you mop and it dries the floor enough to work. Now's the hard part. You have to fix the
                pipe. It takes a lot of effort, help, and time, but eventually you give it all straightened out.
                Does that mean you're done?<br /><br />

                Not quite. You're house is still in pretty bad shape. All that water damaged walls and ruined
                furniture. You now set about replacing furniture, saving what can be saved and tossing what can't.
                It hurts to see the damage but you push on. You even rip up the walls and find more structural
                damage that you then go on to fix. Then you mop again, and paint, and you're done.<br /><br />

                You can open the faucet again. And in this process, you also learned how the things in your home
                really work. What is truly valuable to you, and what to do when things break.
