                My thoughts on the films I have watched. This list only goes back a few years but in that time I
                have watched a lot of movies. I don't have a lot to say about every movie, sometimes it's just
                something I watched a few years back.

                        Many thanks to this film. There are so many angles to look at this film. Is Isla a Jesus analog
                        or an anti-christ? Both heal and bring fish and cause social upheaval. Or perhaps we look at the
                        value of labor and the consequences of live without purpose and with over dependence on an
                        external source of support. Or we can look at how Isla is being mistreated not only when
                        tensions rise and she is no longer able to perform, but also being mistreated by getting too
                        much attention and responsibility. All of these perspectives and likely others I didn't mention
                        work together seamlessly to tell this tragic tale.

                        <strong>Gaza Is Our Home</strong><br /><br />
                        Palestinian film maker Monear Shaer made Gaza Is Our Home to share his and his family's personal
                        relationship with Gaza and the 150+ family members still there before the Israeli genocide began
                        in retaliation to the Palestinian people's attempt to liberate themselves from
                        colonialism.<br><br>

                        The film is a deeply personal documentary featuring Monear and his family in the very beginning
                        of the American backed genocide. Introduced personally by Monear at a screening, we see his
                        experiences in Gaza, the multiple previous assaults on Gaza, and the impact of the first few
                        weeks of the genocide on him and his family. It's heart wrenching. I have never cried so hard in
                        the presence of so many people.<br><br>

                        Free Palestine now and forever inshAllah.

                        The torturer, in their attempt to dehumanize their captive, only dehumanize themselves. The
                        captive, in their resistance and mere existence, reaffirm their humanity. Watching this film
                        shows just a glimpse of the vile character of the Israeli occupation and their disgusting
                        treatment of the Palestinian people. How vile and weak do a people have to be to be able to
                        treat others as the Israelis treat the Palestinians? Is this what Fanon saw in the French
                        tortures of Algerians? Is this what it's like now in Sudan, or was like in Vietnam? The right to
                        armed resistance is reaffirmed with every abduction. Until total liberation.

                        <strong>Children Of Shatila</strong><br /><br />
                        Another documentary film by the maker of Frontiers of Dreams and Fears, Children of Shatila
                        follows survivors of the Zionist massacre of Sabra and Shatila and their descendants,
                        specifically two children named Issa and Farah.<br><br>
                        We follow the human toll of the continues evils of the Zionist project and are reminded once
                        more that this did not start with Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. The massacre as Sabra and Shatila
                        were conducted on 16–18 September 1982, and they are not unique in colonial history.<br><br>
                        All colonized peoples have a Sabra and Shatila, and thus we are bound together to resist these
                        evils and end imperialism once and for all.

                        anti-colonialism, we must necessary study those who came before us, so that we can effectively
                        pick up where they left off.<br><br>

                        This film is a direct communication from the thinkers who came before us, most famously Ghassan
                        Kanafani, as they outline for us their current conditions and they goals. Watching this film
                        gave me a sense of continuity and duty. People came before me and lived, struggled, gave a lot
                        and in many cases gave everything for the liberation movement and our duty is to continue their
                        work.

                        I laughed a few times. I found some moments funny, the movie as a whole was entertaining. It
                        stayed safely at the very surface of the underlying politics of the plot. Of course not every
                        movie is going to be a fundamental dissection of class, even I'm not that boring. I enjoyed it
                        but found it too light and fleeting, too mundane. Maybe that was the point.<br><br>
                        It's as if the movie was made to be referenced by youtube essayists 20 years later. Presentism,

                        <strong>Superman (2025)</strong><br /><br />
                        I had no intention of watching this film until my friends, and basically everyone on the
                        internet, swore up and down that it was a pro-Palestine film. I still didn't believe them
                        because how can such a massive franchise so deeply imbedded in Hollywood be anything like that.
                        My friends fought me tooth and nail and finally made me watch it and I was pleasantly surprised.
                        It's as clear as could be without being explicit. Sure, the invading country speaks
                        Serbo-Croatian, but other than that it's clear cut that Boravia is the Israel stand in and
                        Jarhanpur is the Palestine stand in. The Borovians have tanks, guns, US made weapons, and are
                        "strong US allies", and the Jarhanpur has sticks and machete's to defend themselves with.
                        Boravians are white, Jarhanpuris are brown. The film is not about Russia and Ukraine (obviously)
                        because if it were, the US would be on the side of the smaller country being invaded. It's also
                        not about the Bosnian genocide because it wouldn't have been two completely different looking
                        people.<br><br>

                        The movie was really good. As a Superman movie it was incredibly satisfying and
                        showed that his whole deal is how do I stop the disaster without losing even a squirrel's life.
                        Superman is naive, and powerful, and kind, and above all he has a clear moral compass. I have to
                        admit I nearly cried.<br><br>

                        We must remember that in real life there is no Superman. There are
                        normal people, struggling, protesting, boycotting, fighting, dying, suing, sabotaging, striking,
                        delaying, speaking, singing, crying, donating, and doing the real liberation working in a
                        million other ways. It was really nice to see Green Lantern give the "Zionists" the middle
                        finger, it was cathartic, but it was not real. Don't allow the film's happy ending lull you into
                        passivity. In the real world we all have to be Superman.

                        <strong>Frontiers of Dreams and Fears</strong><br /><br />
                        We often hear and read about Palestinian children after something horrible has been done to them
                        by Israelis. It's far less common for us to see them living life as it is in Palestine and in
                        the refugee camps in Lebanon. This film follows two 14 year old Palestinian girls as they live
                        what is considered a normal life as a Palestinian refugee. They're so normal. I see my cousins
                        in them. They do homework, have friends, talk about boys, eat, laugh, cry. Of course I knew
                        this, but I hadn't seen anyone talk about it or show it. Always we see Palestinian children in
                        the midst of Zionist made, US funded famine and genocide. The film follows as the girls travel
                        to the barb wired border and meet other Palestinians, the scenes made me cry. All the while the
                        Zionist presence threatens life. Near the end of the movie the Intifada begins and we see the
                        reality. The cowardly blood lusting Israelis shooting at children throwing rocks. The movie is
                        set in 2006. Two decades later, we still fight for Palestinian liberation.

                        <strong>Leila and the Wolves</strong><br /><br />
                        Leila takes us back in time to the struggle against the British and the Zionists in Palestine
                        and Lebanon. She shows the audience the role that women played in the struggle, a whole often
                        diminished or ignored all together. The film does not deride the men who fought and died, in
                        fact the film does not focus on them at all. They are acknowledged, mentioned, and recognized
                        but they are not the focus. Instead we see how the women sacrificed all they had, risked life
                        and limb to spy, smuggle weapons, misdirect enemy troops, and fight the enemy head on. There is
                        no romanticism. It's ugly, and painful, and real.<br><br>
                        The film is interspersed with film and photographs from the real events portrayed, and was
                        filmed in dangerous places. Women have always been an integral part of the struggle, and we do
                        ourselves a great disservice by not remembering that.

                        Well... I did not realize I was watching a comedy until a ways in. I just thought it was a bad

                        The film begins with odd and ominous scenes of violence and horror, and at first neither you not
                        the characters know what is going on. By the end of the film, the beginning scenes make total
                        sense and you wish you could tell the characters. I see why this film is held in such high
                        regard, Carpenter killed it.

                        Sometimes the best way to expose evil is to let it speak for itself. The documentary film makers
                        interview old people who witnessed, perpetrated, or were victims of the Nakba. You might think
                        that this isn't a both sides issue, that Israeli terrorists shouldn't be given any space to
                        speak. I thought so too until I heard them speak. No remorse. Cold monsters that continue to be
                        proud of their actions. They acknowledge the Nakba is genocide and they stand by it. Israelis
                        are truly a vile people.

                        loved how normal their looked. No one was runway model attractive, no one had quips, it was all
                        done so well.

                        Freedom of speech is a right in the United States, and like all rights and laws it is applied
                        selectively and in ways that benefit those in power. We see this again in the Palestine
                        Exception, free speech is great until students in the United States decide to use their voices
                        to protest genocide, then they are violently shut down. The film shows the encampments and the
                        reaction of academia to peaceful protest.

                        The Zionists steal your home, murder your family, ethnically cleanse the land, wage genocide on
                        your people, and occasionally offer you the opportunity to visit home (you must pay them for the
                        privilege of course and purchase their goods while you are there.) do you take it offer? It
                        might be the only time you ever get to see your stolen home. You might be martyred by them
                        before the next chance, before liberation. This impossible question is at the center of the
                        documentary short film The Eid Gift. The answer may appear clear now but the reality is far more
                        difficult.

                        It's one thing to read about Palestine, talk to Palestinians, watch the news of Palestinian
                        events, it's a whole other thing to experience Palestinian stories. The film may be fictional,
                        but the checkpoints, the harassment, the abuse, the danger, the dispossession, the frustration
                        and anger and pain. That is all real.<br /><br />
                        Salt of this Sea follows a Palestinian women as she returns to her homeland and finds it filled
                        with a hostile and brutal occupier. Her mobility, language, appearance, love, and mere existence
                        is an act of rebellion against the tyrannical apartheid state. You see plainly the Banality of
                        Evil as everyone from TSA to illegal occupier participates in the oppression. Even those who
                        seem outwardly progressive are shown to be simply acting the part in the shallowest sense.

                        Disappointing Ghibli film. It was lacking that special something the other films have, really
                        felt short and empty.

                        Absolute must watch for anyone interested in the revolution, American racism, and the Black
                        Panthers. It's one thing to read about the events of the film, and it's a completely different
                        thing to watch them. The most incredible part is that Fred Hampton's wife and son are still
                        alive today and according to interviews they loved the film.

                        a good father.

                        This is a fictional film, but is it really? I've met guys like this, I'm sure they were even
                        worse back in those days. Sure, the events of this particular movie aren't real, but events and
                        people like them have. Sometimes we forget that California became so rich because of all the war
                        criminals, war profiteers, and war mongers. This "defense" engineer, which is a misnomer in and
                        of itself, this war engineer is just one of many. Plenty more don't lose their jobs and go on a
                        rampage, instead being praised and well compensated for the hell they unleash.

                        through and through. I'm really glad I read the book first because the plot itself is very
                        trimmed, and I'm not sure how much sense everything makes if you haven't read the book first. I
                        really hope there is an extended cut like the Lord of the Rings.

                        It was okay. Nothing stood out as particularly compelling, the main characters journey was not
                        very interesting, and the outcome was boring. The dream-like oddness of the setting made it hard
                        for me to latch on, it felt as arbitrary as old folk tales. It's like I'm missing a significant
                        cultural context that I would only have if I was a medieval peasant.

                        the crime you get live out the moments before the event and investigate it on a loop until you
                        figure it out. Might make a really interesting video game idea.

                        Well first off: Train. Really my thoughts could end right there but as if "train" wasn't enough,
                        we have here "train" by Bong Joon-ho. Enough said right? What could I possibly say about
                        Snowpiercer that hasn't been expressed already?

                        <strong>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</strong><br /><br />
                        When this movie first came out I completely skipped it because I never watch trailers and I
                        misunderstood it to be more of a documentary about Hollywood. I don't know what gave me that
                        impression given the director. Eventually I did watch it and I'm really glad I did. The tension
                        in the commune, the crime, the balance of the two leads, the dog. Great movie as usual by
                        Tarantino.

                        Ballerina is a somewhat generic action film in the style of John Wick. It's a satisfying revenge
                        story though not an especially deep one.

                        Capitalism is not the solution to oppression, it is the root cause. Women becoming the oppressor
                        solves nothing and isn't what feminists at large want. But the film clearly would rather present
                        a "Conservative Capitalist" antagonist who is defeated at then end of the film not through
                        revolution but through willingly transforming into "Progressive Capitalism". The film claims
                        that nothing really needs to change in the world, we just need some female representation in the
                        oppressive class. But no. Capitalism can cover itself in Kente cloth, wear high heels, hold a
                        rainbow flag, but it is still the cause of the world suffering. Don't be fooled by false
                        promises.

                        This may be the archetypical heist movie. Maybe there is an earlier film that did it first or
                        maybe even better, but as far as I know when one talks about a heist, one usually means to pull
                        an Oceans 11. One thing that stands out though is Don Cheadle's accent. What were they thinking
                        with that?

                        Apparently this is a true story. I didn't look too much into the real people that went to the
                        school or worked there but this is one way to "fix" a bag school. Just be tougher with those
                        kids, that's what they need. And the "bad" kids? Throw them out, they are unsavable refuse.
                        Obviously I do not agree with this kind of method. Even if you "saved" the "good" kids, you
                        would not have repaired their environment which caused them to need saving in the first place.
                        Partial solutions like this seem reasonable until you realize that not only are they inhumane to
                        those you reject, they also don't help the ones you include long term. Not to mention the
                        radicalized character of those rejections.

                        I hated this movie. I read <a href="books.html#2001_a_space_odyssey_book_review">the book</a>
                        right before watching it so I had a whole mental picture of what it should look like which was
                        also informed by the aesthetics of modern science fiction films. I didn't expect it to look like
                        Dune, but I at least wanted to see something like Alien. Instead I got something far worse than
                        the David Lynch Dune and that is horrendous. Bad pacing, bad visuals, boring acting, didn't like
                        HAL. Maybe I'm just a hater (entirely possible) or maybe the book set too high of a bar
                        (unlikely, the book wasn't mind blowing either) but I just hate this movie.

                        full breath of Brother Malcolm's life and beliefs, though it downplays his Islam which was
                        central to everything in his life. All people in "America" or who want to understand America
                        must study and understand Brother Malcolm and this is a great introduction, but there is so much
                        more to him. Read his speeches in chronological order to understand his ideological trajectory,
                        read books about him, learn what he tried to teach and carry his torch forward.

                        This movie is just so cute. The relationship between Juno and her boyfriend and her family feels
                        warm and genuine. We follow as Juno deals with her pregnancy, trying to decide what she wants
                        for herself and the people close to her, and eventually decides to have the baby and give it up
                        for adoption. Genuinely a sweet movie for a quiet night.

                        The fur is so well done! That was my first thought when seeing the characters move and speak.
                        The movie is typical Wes Anderson fun, the shots are orthogonal and stylized, the writing is
                        funny and irreverent and the stop motion animation is excellent.

                        I did not expect a D&D movie to be made and certainly did not expect it to be this good. When I
                        saw it was first announced I expect it to be filled with 4th wall breaks and tabletop references
                        like dice rolls and such but no. They took it seriously and made a really good action comedy. It
                        was really nice to see all these fantastical creatures brought to life in such a beautiful way.

                        IRA won and will eventually reunite Ireland God willing. The sun has set on the British empire

                        bad creepy weirdo for doing what he does in the film but it sure it a great car crash to watch
                        happen. Something about Jake makes me think it's not all acting.

                        <strong>Minority Report</strong><br /><br />
                        Based on a 1954 Philip K. Dick story, the Minority Report is only becoming more accurate the
                        longer we go. Everything from the Patriot Act to Palantir to "AI" powered law enforcement shows
                        that we are in an increasingly repressive time. The film uses people as super computers with
                        mental powers that allow them to predict crime highly accurately, or so it seems. And as usual,
                        the people in power see the worst ideas and warnings of the creatives and only think of how to
                        build them. Don't create the Torment Nexus.

                        Twelve men in a single room. The budget is a shoe string. No CGI, not even color. And yet, one
                        of the best movies ever made. With all the fluff stripped out you are left with pure writing and
                        acting. And it makes sense because it started out as a play.

                        Very weird but still kinda fun. Didn't leave much of an impact. Maybe it would have been a

                        this movie so I came out and watched it in theaters and enjoyed a good time with my friends.
                        Except it was one of those dine in theaters so everything stunk of burgers and fried onions for
                        the whole runtime of the movie.

                        Kiki's is one of my least favorite Ghibli films and the only one I ever quit watching before it
                        was over. I think I got about 80% of the way in before I just gave up. It's so boring,
                        absolutely nothing happening. I was actually surprised that Kiki has pretty much nothing to
                        struggle against. No antagonistic characters, no internal struggle, no natural barriers. Just a
                        girl doing deliveries.

                        Back when the film was first announced I immediately knew I had to read the book first. So I
                        made sure not to watch any trailers (as usual) and read the book and loved it. Then I watched
                        the film on release. There are whole massive chunks of the book entirely missing, but what is
                        shown is incredible. I was wholly engrossed for the entirety of the film. The sound, the music,
                        the visuals, the whole experience was exceptional. One nitpick is that the arabic pronunciations
                        are abysmal, were there no available language coaches? Anyway, I eagerly await the <a

                        Sonic the Hedgehog is the first good movie based on a video game. There were cartoons and
                        comics, which likely were a major factor in the movie's success. I watched in on opening night
                        with friends and we had a great time.

                        needed more. It's funny, it's sweet, and it shows the struggles of the people left behind by
                        South Korea's extremely capitalist society, what more can you ask for? I'll tell you what more

                        The theme song is etched into my brain, I whistle it without realizing I am. The little steam
                        boat toy got me interested in the physics of how it worked, and the Morse flash light Sosuke has
                        is one of my most wanted trinkets.
