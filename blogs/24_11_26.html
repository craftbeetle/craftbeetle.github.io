            </div>
            
            <p>
                Should I stay or should I go?<br /><br />
                This is not a new question, it isn't informed by recent events. Though those events haven't helped,
                the alternative would not have changed my mind. Those who came before me asked the same question and
                landed on go. Now I am asking the same and considering the options.<br /><br />
                Should I cut my roots and become a stranger again? The last time I didn't have strong roots but I
                also didn't have resistant branches. This time my roots are deeper but my truck and branches are
                much more solid. I could move to more fertile soil or work against the tide to repair the local
                erosion.<br /><br />
                Should I end my complicity in these evil systems or should I stay and resist them? My mere existence
                here fuels their system and resistance from without is crippling the beast. They always say that you
                cannot change a system from within yet leaving would help me and leave others behind to struggle.
                Is it wrong that I can leave when others cannot? Was it wrong that those before me left when others
                could not?<br /><br />
                Do I owe this place anything? Is divestment resistance? Should I go back home or find a new home?
                Will it be any different anywhere else? Would I still be a stranger in my own home? Could I ever
                find peace where I am? Are the cost and effort of staying greater than those of leaving?<br /><br />
                I might find life better away from the fire, where the embers fall. I might be able to build a real
                life where people actually think about their neighbors. I might be able to find peace where the
                stakes are low, opportunities are few, but failure is mild. Where taxes don't fund genocides, where
                streets are for human beings, where food isn't deadly, where the future looks up.<br /><br />
                Am I willing to take the risk, to give up my global advantage, to gamble with my future, to reset my
                social life?<br /><br />
                I'll think about it a bit more, search for a new home, try to find reasons to stay, do my due
                diligence.<br /><br />
                So I ask:<br />
                Should I stay or should I go?<br /><br />
