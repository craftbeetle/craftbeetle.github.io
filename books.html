                            I was already familiar with Real Wages, but I had not thought of Relative Wages which are
                            really the root of the income inequality by definition. As well I have a new appreciation
                            for the gig economy as as the ideal capitalist labor market, where all tasks are fractalized
                            and stecato, disconnecting the labourer from the labor and for each other, opening the door
                            for infinite scabs.

                            <strong>Abandoned Palestine Refugee</strong><br /><br />
                            I met Ihmayed Ali and his daughter at a Palestinian book talk where they shared about their
                            lives and experiences as Palestinian refugees. The talk was moving and eye opening. I then
                            bought and read his book and was blown away by the images he shared. Ihmayed's autobiography
                            is written in a very vivid and honest way. The things he goes through, the oppression and
                            abuse, the survival and success. His story is representative of large portions of the
                            Palestinian population, a people who endure despite incredible hardship. I highly recommend
                            this book to anyone seeking a personal look at the Palestinian story.

                            <strong>Moby Dick</strong><br /><br />
                            This book is absolutely massive. Melville clearly loves and knows much about whaling and he
                            wants to share it all and it takes 600 pages to do so. I didn't love the book in all honesty
                            but I do respect it. It is one of the oldest books I've read and had it come out in recent
                            decades someone would have made him cut it down but I'm glad it exists in its entirety. A
                            book about whales ought to be massive. I wouldn't recommend most people read it but the
                            audiobook by William Hootkins is very good. I switch to it about half way through reading my
                            physical copy.

                            An easy introduction into communist theory. This is absolutely a must read that lays out
                            communism for the layman. I found it put already known and understood concepts into a new
                            perspective, shed a light on some connection previously missed.

                            If ever there was a manual on how to be a good father, this would be a contender. This also
                            goes for what it means to be a man. The way Harper Lee describes Atticus's interactions with
                            his children and his community and the high regard in which they hold him shows what a man
                            of integrity is, and shoots dead the idea that people in the past were simply a product of
                            their time. A wonderful read and a pretty good movie.

                            A beautiful book that explores one possible way that anarcho-communism could exist. Le Guin
                            does a great job of constructing a believable society with all of its struggles and beauty.
                            Even if this isn't the exact way I imagine an ideal world, I find inspiration and hope in
                            the refutation of the status quo as all that there ever could be. If this is a plausible
                            formulation of society, what else is possible? A worthwhile and captivating read.

                            A neat view into the origins of the Punisher. One can easily see how plausible this course
                            of character development is and how it leads to one to believe that they are the law and
                            that their violence is justified. A valuable window into cop culture.

                            What can I say about 1984 that hadn't been said already? I originally decided to read this
                            book so that I could confidently say "I read 1984". I only half joke. But as I got into the
                            book I discovered what all the hype was about. It wasn't mind blowing but I also read it in
                            a post 1984 world which has for nearly 80 years been deeply affected by it. My most
                            appreciated part of the book is how long ago it was written and how it remains relevant
                            today.

                            This comic, and Spider Jerusalem, are one of my favorites. Real politics and journalism in a
                            near future US city. It gave me the same feeling of appreciation for journalism that A Taxi
                            Driver (the Korean film) gave me. The world needs more Spider Jerusalem's that do true
                            honest journalism at all costs and by all means necessary.
