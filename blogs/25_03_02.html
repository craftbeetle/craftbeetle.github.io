                The algorithm is designed to make you consume only new media to keep you guessing what comes next.
                Acclimating you to simply ingest whatever is placed in front of you and lower your cognitive
                defenses and filters. That way when an ad or propaganda is slipped into the feed, you will ingest it
                organically and naturally, causing it to have a much greater effect on you.<br /><br />

                Imagine if someone tried to put an ad in the middle of an album you loved. You would immediately
                notice. But if they slipped the ad in the middle of an algorithmic picked music shuffle, you are
                much more likely to listen to more or all of the ad and thus it will have a greater effect on
                you.<br /><br />

                The average person on the internet has been gradually trained to accept that they will have little
                to no control over what they will see. I've heard countless people say that "their algorithm
                understands them" or that "their algorithm got messed up because they watched too much of a certain
                thing".<br /><br />

                People who allow themselves to become passive consumers are eventually fattened up and lead to the
                slaughterhouse.<br /><br />

                The advertising model is inherently capitalistic (read exploitative), thus it should be fought tooth
                and nail. Block all ads, use pi hole, use SponsorBlock, make a pfSense router, etc... Your views
                earned the creators of that media very little money, a fraction of a penny, but cost you a great
                deal in your intellectual autonomy. If you enjoy something, donate or buy from that creator. Giving
                a youtuber a single dollar is more than they will ever earn from a lifetime of your views. And,
                donating to them directly ensures that middlemen like Google AdSense doesn't take a cut.<br /><br />

                Your privacy and autonomy is being eroded for profit, and you are being guilt tripped into engaging
                with predatory systems. Resist, it's easy, it's a better experience for you, and it will push the
                internet into a more sustainable and less exploitative model. <br /><br />
