                <summary>25.04.20 - <strong>Unpaid Domestic Labor</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    All labor should be collectivized. This includes domestic labor. Sounds radical but hear me out (and
                    I'm not the first to think of this by a long shot):

                <h3>The Problem</h3>

                We currently live in a time where it is generally accepted that there is work done outside for
                money, and there is work done at home because it has to be done. One is paid, one is unpaid. In the
                current capitalist formulation, men do a larger proportion of the paid labor, and women do a
                larger proportion of the unpaid labor. It can be more or less evenly distributed based on time,
                place, context, culture, etc...

                <h3>What Should We Do About It</h3>

                As a society, we should transform all unpaid individual domestic labor into paid collective labor.
                Sounds extreme and unfeasible at first but consider that we have already done so with so many
                forms of labor. In fact, I argue that all labor use to be unpaid domestic labor performed individually
                or collectively.

                <h3>Examples of Previously Collectivized Labor</h3>

                <li>People use to garden for food, we turned that into commercial agriculture.</li>
                <li>People use to make their own clothes, we turned that into the textiles industry.</li>
                <li>People use to cook their own food, teach their own kids, treat their own wounds, we turned those
                    into restaurants, schools, and hospitals.</li><br />

                In fact, all domestic labor currently performed also simultaneously exists in its collective paid
                form elsewhere. If you've ever stayed at a hotel then you have experienced it. Your room was
                cleaned, you laundry was washed, your breakfast was made, your car was parked.

                <h3>The Benefits of Paid Collectivized Labor</h3>

                The benefits of this collective paid labor are numerous. For starters, you don't have to do any of
                that labor yourself, which frees your time and energy for other things. And secondly, the person
                doing that labor does it regularly and thus is not only far more efficient, they are also better
                equipped and can benefit from the division of labor and the economy of scale. Thirdly, this system
                is a far more efficient use of resources which protects ecology as well as reduces the amount of
                labor required to maintain the system.

                <h3>Resource and Time Improvements</h3>

                You and each person in your neighborhood each own a vacuum, a hammer, a washing machine, a lawn mower,
                a plastic bottle of window cleaning fluid, and so on. Each of these items gets used for a few hours
                per month, yet they each required so much labor to create. And when they need maintenance or
                replacement, those who would do that labor must travel from house to house or you must come to them.
                More likely you'll be throwing the item away and buying a new one. How wasteful.<br /><br />

                Meanwhile, in the hotel, one maintenance team with one set of tools services many room far more
                efficiently.

                <h3>Who stands to gain? Who stands to lose?</h3>

                All workers benefit from collective paid labor. Under the current system of labor division,
                those who are paid for their labor have more power than those who are not. Money is power because
                money is the ability to get what you want. With money you can buy food, shelter, healthcare,
                transportation, etc... If one person has money and the other does not, then the person without money
                must obey those that have it in order to gain access to those resources and services. This is the
                case between the boss and the worker, the master and the slave, the paid commercial laborer and the
                unpaid domestic laborer.<br /><br />

                By abolishing this unfair distinction between what is paid labor and what is unpaid labor (which
                often falls along gendered and racialized lines), we further improve fairness in society.<br /><br />

                We all gain, the capitalist is the only one to lose. The capitalist loses what was never theirs to
                begin with, they are punished by having to live as equals with the rest of the world.

                <h3>Examples:</h3>

                <li>Jim works at a restaurant. He earns 200 dollars over 8 hours of labor, cooking to feed many
                    people.</li>
                <li>Maya works as a house cleaner. She earns 180 dollars over 8 hours of labor, cleaning the homes of
                    many people.</li>
                <li>Mahmood works as a kindergarten teacher. He makes 170 dollars over 8 hours of labor, teaching and
                    caring for many young children.</li><br />

                <li>Alex is a stay at home parent. They earn 0 dollars over 8 hours of labor, cooking, cleaning,
                    teaching, and caring for their children.</li>
                <li>Jessie works as a driver. They earn 190 dollars a day for 8 hours of labor, driving many people.
                    They then come home and earn 0 dollars over 8 hours of labor, caring for a disabled family
                    member.</li>

                <h3>Who's to Blame?</h3>

                <strong>Patriarchy?</strong><br /> Patriarchy plays a role in determining who stays home to perform
                unpaid labor, but it doesn't fully explain why that unpaid labor is done in the first place.<br /><br />
                <strong>Racism?</strong><br /> This also plays a role in determining who has access to resources and who
                must labor unpaid, but again it does not fully explain the unpaid labor itself.<br /><br />
                <strong>Capitalism?</strong><br /> This is the root cause of unpaid labor in the current system.
                Exploitation of labor, the stratification of what is and is not worthy of payment and how much payment.
                You see, capitalism requires exploitation. It requires underpaid and unpaid labor for it to be able to
                extract profits. For those profits ARE the money that should have been paid to the underpaid and the
                unpaid. Profits are money taken by those who do nothing. In a fair society there is no profit, because
                there is no exploitation. There is still pay, just not profit.<br /><br />

                <h3>How Capitalism Causes the Problem</h3>

                If you are an underpaid laborer, a man working in a steel mill for example. You may feel the urge to
                revolt, to demand more, to demand what is rightfully yours. Communists all over the world have done
                so to great success many times. But there is an alternative path the capitalists would rather you go
                down, fascism, racism, sexism, etc... The artificial creation of an underclass of even more
                exploited people who will subsidize your existence. In return, you will keep them down.<br /><br />

                The underpaid man in the steel mill can join forces with the women of the textile mill, and the
                black slaves in the fields, and all the rest of the variably exploited people and demand fairness
                for all.<br /><br />

                Or, they can force women to also work at home, unpaid. To force black people to labor for less or
                nothing. To maintain this layered system of oppression through systemic racism (Jim Crow, Red
                Lining, Police Brutality, Israeli/South African Apartheid, etc...), systemic sexism ("Women belong
                pregnant, barefoot, in the kitchen", "Women are just more nurturing", "Men evolved to hunt and fight,
                women evolved to raise children and care for the home"). But is it not clear to the man in the steel
                mill that the true benefactor of all of this oppression and exploitation is the capitalist, the owner of
                the steel mill. In making you a subservient oppressor they have simultaneously created an even more
                exploited class of workers and staved off your own revolution.

                <h3>Typical Unpaid Labor:</h3>

                <li>Cleaning</li>
                <li>Laundry</li>
                <li>Preparing Food</li>
                <li>Child/Elderly/Disabled Care</li>
                <li>Shopping</li>
                <li>Home Construction/Repairs</li>

                <h3>Doesn't Capitalism Do This?</h3>

                As stated above, all labor already exists in a collectivized and paid form, but under capitalism it is
                only accessible for those with enough money and the workers doing that labor are usually the least paid.
                Capitalism, the "free" market, will never be a liberational force specifically because it is an
                exploitative and extractive system.

                <h3>What about privacy?</h3>

                Same as in a hotel, if you don't want your room cleaned, just tell maintenance not to clean it. No
                one will force you to use any of these collective labor systems. Just as you can cook your own food
                or buy your meals from a restaurant, each service is opt-in. Though you will find that it is much more
                convenient to opt-in, especially under communism, where all people have equal access to these services.

                <h3>Isn't Doing Unpaid Domestic Labor a Form of Love?</h3>

                Doing any kind of labor can be a show of love. From domestic labor to defensive war. But that love
                ends where coercion begins. It is not love to be forced to do something, because showing love is a
                consequence of choice.

                <h3>What Can You Do Now?</h3>

                Join or create a local organization rooted in communism and dedicated to the elimination of unpaid
                domestic labor. Then, collectivize your labor:<br /><br />
                <li>Cook communally.</li>
                <li>Clean for those who need it.</li>
                <li>Regularly visit the elder members of your community.</li>
                <li>Babysit collectively.</li>
                <li>Fix each other's clothes, tools, bikes, cars, homes.</li>
                <li>Lend each other tools.</li>
                <li>Shop for those who cannot.</li>
                <li>Grow food for yourselves in community gardens.</li><br />

                You'll quickly find that one shopping trip can serve a whole neighborhood. One sewing machine can
                fix everyone's worn clothes. A few hours of cooking can feed many families for days. You'll spend
                less time and money, and you'll build a much stronger community. One that needs no police, requires
                much less assistance to survive, and one that can solve its problems much more efficiently.<br /><br />

                <p>
                    The algorithm is designed to make you consume only new media to keep you guessing what comes next.
                    Acclimating you to simply ingest whatever is placed in front of you and lower your cognitive
                    defenses and filters. That way when an ad or propaganda is slipped into the feed, you will ingest it
                    organically and naturally, causing it to have a much greater effect on you.<br /><br />

                    Imagine if someone tried to put an ad in the middle of an album you loved. You would immediately
                    notice. But if they slipped the ad in the middle of an algorithmic picked music shuffle, you are
                    much more likely to listen to more or all of the ad and thus it will have a greater effect on
                    you.<br /><br />

                    The average person on the internet has been gradually trained to accept that they will have little
                    to no control over what they will see. I've heard countless people say that "their algorithm
                    understands them" or that "their algorithm got messed up because they watched too much of a certain
                    thing".<br /><br />

                    People who allow themselves to become passive consumers are eventually fattened up and lead to the
                    slaughterhouse.<br /><br />

                    The advertising model is inherently capitalistic (read exploitative), thus it should be fought tooth
                    and nail. Block all ads, use pi hole, use SponsorBlock, make a pfSense router, etc... Your views
                    earned the creators of that media very little money, a fraction of a penny, but cost you a great
                    deal in your intellectual autonomy. If you enjoy something, donate or buy from that creator. Giving
                    a youtuber a single dollar is more than they will ever earn from a lifetime of your views. And,
                    donating to them directly ensures that middlemen like Google AdSense doesn't take a cut.<br /><br />

                    Your privacy and autonomy is being eroded for profit, and you are being guilt tripped into engaging
                    with predatory systems. Resist, it's easy, it's a better experience for you, and it will push the
                    internet into a more sustainable and less exploitative model. <br /><br />

                <p>
                    This website has been a lot of fun so far. I have enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
                    the creative process of designing a user experience. The most rewarding part has been the feedback I
                    get from my friends after they visit my site and learn about the things I make, the plants and
                    animals I see, and my thoughts on the media I enjoy.<br /><br />

                    It started out very simple and I have successfully kept it consistent and easy to manage. The
                    content is easy to post and update and the organization and feel of the site has matured over
                    time.<br /><br />

                    Now that the site is stabilized and matured, I think it would be interesting to experiment some
                    more. I have fallen into a pattern, which has been immensely helpful in keeping me on track, but now
                    I want to try new things. I also want to break out of the idea that all content has to be perfect
                    before I post it. As I have thought, written, and created more, I have realized that the old adage
                    that "Perfect is the enemy of good." is true here as well. Why hold back on writing my thought on a
                    thing just because I don't think I'll perfectly express everything I want to express? These are the
                    inhibitions of the big social media platforms, where creation is product, not art.<br /><br />

                    In short I will try to be a bit more organic and less inhibited in this site. This has never been a
                    professional product to be sold, so I shouldn't treat it as such. It's my personal website and I
                    invite you to continue enjoying it, flaws and all.<br /><br />

                <summary>24.12.15 - <strong>Inner Monologue</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    Some people have internal monologues and some people do not. It's also likely that people can
                    transition between the two, and use the two modes depending on the task. Could this be analogous to
                    the generative AI's pure vector math and its abstraction through the transformer?<br /><br />

                    I use both the internal monologue as well as the wordless mode of thinking. Some of my thoughts are
                    rhetorical and so it is as if I am having a conversation with myself. An internal dialectic that
                    produces synthesized ideas. Other thoughts are physical, like 3D objects and physics calculations,
                    and those I process wordlessly, often accompanied with either mental images or just mathematical
                    intuition, like mental vectors.<br /><br />

                    One interesting consequence of this is that for technical projects most of the work I do is entirely
                    in my head. I design, manufacture, test, and iterate completely in my imagination. If asked to
                    describe my thoughts to a fellow engineer, I give exact step by step instructions that will
                    perfectly reproduce what I am thinking, and I am usually correct in my designs. Going back to the AI
                    analogy, it is as if I load a pruned physics model into my mind's RAM, add in LORAs and embeddings
                    for whatever material or special condition I am working with, and do all my work in this virtual
                    environment. Then, when I sit at a computer with SolidWorks or an IDE I simply export my thoughts
                    into reality. I am so familiar with SolidWorks and Python that by the time I actually sit down to
                    export, my fingers do all the work and my mind is off.<br /><br />

                    I don't think this is unique for me. My guess is that most people trained in certain tasks do this.
                    Musicians can compose music in their minds, architects imagine buildings, writers create characters
                    away from the page, mathematicians wrestle numbers away from the chalkboard. I asked a fellow
                    engineer if this was the case for them as well and they replied in the affirmative, perfectly
                    describing my own process.<br /><br />

                    This isn't to say that there is never a need to work things out outside of the mind. This mostly
                    works for things we are really good at, as for the rest, and usually more complicated things with
                    unknown variables, a more systematic and deliberate approach is needed.<br /><br />

                    There seems to be a need for both types of thinking. The question usually asked is:<br /><br />

                    How do people with/without an inner monologue think?<br /><br />

                    I think the more interesting question is:<br /><br />

                    Why doesn't everyone use both modes of thinking?<br /><br />

                <summary>24.11.26 - <strong>Stay of Go</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    Should I stay or should I go?<br /><br />
                    This is not a new question, it isn't informed by recent events. Though those events haven't helped,
                    the alternative would not have changed my mind. Those who came before me asked the same question and
                    landed on go. Now I am asking the same and considering the options.<br /><br />
                    Should I cut my roots and become a stranger again? The last time I didn't have strong roots but I
                    also didn't have resistant branches. This time my roots are deeper but my truck and branches are
                    much more solid. I could move to more fertile soil or work against the tide to repair the local
                    erosion.<br /><br />
                    Should I end my complicity in these evil systems or should I stay and resist them? My mere existence
                    here fuels their system and resistance from without is crippling the beast. They always say that you
                    cannot change a system from within yet leaving would help me and leave others behind to struggle.
                    Is it wrong that I can leave when others cannot? Was it wrong that those before me left when others
                    could not?<br /><br />
                    Do I owe this place anything? Is divestment resistance? Should I go back home or find a new home?
                    Will it be any different anywhere else? Would I still be a stranger in my own home? Could I ever
                    find peace where I am? Are the cost and effort of staying greater than those of leaving?<br /><br />
                    I might find life better away from the fire, where the embers fall. I might be able to build a real
                    life where people actually think about their neighbors. I might be able to find peace where the
                    stakes are low, opportunities are few, but failure is mild. Where taxes don't fund genocides, where
                    streets are for human beings, where food isn't deadly, where the future looks up.<br /><br />
                    Am I willing to take the risk, to give up my global advantage, to gamble with my future, to reset my
                    social life?<br /><br />
                    I'll think about it a bit more, search for a new home, try to find reasons to stay, do my due
                    diligence.<br /><br />
                    So I ask:<br />
                    Should I stay or should I go?<br /><br />

                <summary>24.08.25 - <strong>Training Data</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    Humans have had their Neural Networks trained over hundreds of thousands of years. Our brains
                    already have all the pathways and connections necessary to process and generate visual, auditory,
                    linguistic, and other types of information. When a human is born, they are not beginning their
                    training but instead are simply fine-tuning an ancient model for new languages, art forms, and
                    ideas.<br /><br />
                    Generative AI on the other hand does not have this benefit. It requires massive amounts of high
                    quality data to train. It also has the critical pitfall of not being able to train on its own
                    outputs because it isn't the center of its own existence. Humans can train on human material because
                    we live for ourselves. AI exists for our benefit, we aren't interested in what the AI thinks, we
                    want it to emulate what we think.<br /><br />
                    So an problem is created when we use AI to generate, then post those generation back to the
                    internet, which then goes back into the AI. Soon, the AI will develop the computational equivalent
                    of prion disease. And the stakeholders of AI companies know this. How then will they get around this
                    issue?<br /><br />
                    One possible solution for them to access fresh, high quality data is by harvesting it right at the
                    source. No longer relying on the intermediary of scrapping the internet, the AI companies will
                    instead contract directly with governments, intelligence agencies, data brokers, and communications
                    companies to record everything in our lives and use it to train AI. How will this look?<br /><br />
                    Expect to see changes to the terms and services of the various software and hardware you use saying
                    something like "By using this product, you are consenting to us collecting your information for AI
                    training purposes. Don't worry, we pinky promise that it's all anonymous.". You might expect to see
                    high speed internet become cheap or even free, so long as the ISP can see what you are doing. You
                    might find that your new phone has an always on camera/microphone for "theft protection" or
                    "security". Your government ID will become a high resolution 3D scan of your face, security cameras
                    will become 8K with film quality microphones, your email will read everything that goes through it,
                    all for the purpose of training AI.<br /><br />
                    I hope this doesn't come across as fear mongering or conspiracy theory. Worry not dear reader, I do
                    believe we landed on the moon, that vaccines do work, and that 5G is just internet. I simply as you
                    to read the terms of service of the products you are using. This issue has already been demonstrated
                    by <a href="https://youtu.be/EXxMCm941WA" target="_blank">Adobe</a>, and
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/JiMXb2NkAxQ?feature=shared" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I'm also not
                    anti-AI by default, but I do agree with many arguments against its training and use. I write this
                    website myself, without the use of generative AI for my writing or images. If you see it or read it
                    here, it's "real". If I ever do use AI in a project in the future, it will be made very clear.

                <p>
                    Passive consumption is their aim for us. They seek to make us drones of capital, laboring, and being
                    pacified with treats and controlled opposition. The 2 minutes of hate as Orwell put it. Even
                    revolutionary seeming media is still designed to be a surrogate for real action. We want a movie
                    about some rebels and we relate to the rebels. In doing so we think that we have somehow struck at
                    the empire. This feeling acts as a release of our feelings and a pacification.
                    <br /><br />
                    To affect real change you have to get up and do something. Go outside and meet your neighbors. Feed
                    those who don't have food. Attend book talks, protests, and fundraisers. Connect with the people and
                    build that lasting change you want to see.

                <summary>24.07.30 - <strong>Wet House</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    You wake up and find every is wet. At first you don't even know what to do. Maybe you do nothing,
                    maybe you do something that helps, maybe you do something makes things worse. Then, for whatever
                    reason, you finally decide to call a plumber. <br /><br />
                    "Hello plumber, my house is wet."<br /><br />
                    "I see, well that is called flooding. It happens when you have a hole in the roof, or a faucet is
                    open while a pipe is clogged, or you're in a hurricane."<br /><br />
                    So you check open the curtain, no hurricane.<br />
                    You check the roof, no hole.<br />
                    You check the bathroom, flooded.<br /><br />
                    Now what? You try to mopping but it just moves water around. You try to scoop it out but you get
                    tired and it gets bad again. You give in and close the faucet. Now the house is still flooded but at
                    the very least it's not getting worse. You start scooping water out and it lowers the level in the
                    bathroom, you mop and it dries the floor enough to work. Now's the hard part. You have to fix the
                    pipe. It takes a lot of effort, help, and time, but eventually you give it all straightened out.
                    Does that mean you're done?<br /><br />
                    Not quite. You're house is still in pretty bad shape. All that water damaged walls and ruined
                    furniture. You now set about replacing furniture, saving what can be saved and tossing what can't.
                    It hurts to see the damage but you push on. You even rip up the walls and find more structural
                    damage that you then go on to fix. Then you mop again, and paint, and you're done.<br /><br />
                    You can open the faucet again. And in this process, you also learned how the things in your home
                    really work. What is truly valuable to you, and what to do when things break.
