                    Passive consumption is their aim for us. They seek to make us drones of capital, laboring, and being
                    passified with treats and controlled opposition. The 2 minutes of hate as Orwell put it. Even
                    revolutionary seeming media is still designed to be a surrogate for real action. We want a movie
                    about some rebels and we relate to the rebels. In doing so we think that we have somehow struck at
                    the empire. This feeling acts as a release of our feelings and a passification.
                    <br /><br />
                    To affect real change you have to get up and do something. Go outside and meet your neighbors. Feed
                    those who don't have food. Attend book talks, protests, and fundraisers. Connect with the people and
                    build that lasting change you want to see.

                    You wake up and find every is wet. At first you don't even know what to do. Maybe you do nothing,
                    maybe you do something that helps, maybe you do something makes things worse. Then, for whatever
                    reason, you finally decide to call a plumber. <br /><br />
                    "Hello plumber, my house is wet."<br /><br />
                    "I see, well that is called flooding. It happens when you have a hole in the roof, or a faucet is
                    open while a pipe is clogged, or you're in a hurricane."<br /><br />
                    So you check open the curtain, no hurricane.<br />
                    You check the roof, no hole.<br />
                    You check the bathroom, flooded.<br /><br />
                    Now what? You try to mopping but it just moves water around. You try to scoop it out but you get
                    tired and it gets bad again. You give in and close the faucet. Now the house is still flooded but at
                    the very least it's not getting worse. You start scooping water out and it lowers the level in the
                    bathroom, you mop and it dries the floor enough to work. Now's the hard part. You have to fix the
                    pipe. It takes a lot of effort, help, and time, but eventually you give it all straigtened out. Does
                    that mean you're done?<br /><br />
                    Not quite. You're house is still in pretty bad shape. All that water damaged walls and ruined
                    furniture. You now set about replacing furniture, saving what can be saved and tossing what can't.
                    It hurts to see the damage but you push on. You even rip up the walls and find more structural
                    damage that you then go on to fix. Then you mop again, and paint, and you're done.<br /><br />
                    You can open the faucet again. And in this process, you also learned how the things in your home
                    really work. What is truly valuable to you, and what to do when things break.<br />
