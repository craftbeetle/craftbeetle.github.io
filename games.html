                Here live some of my thoughts on the games I have completed or played enough of. Sometimes I have a
                lot to say about the games I spend hours playing. Sometimes I play a game for a few hours, think
                it's neat, and put it down forever.

                    <p> <strong>Celeste</strong><br /><br />
                        I had originally bounced off of Celeste the first few times I tried it. Something about the
                        controls and getting stuck on some level or another. I picked it up again after finishing
                        Silksong. The controls are much, much more simple and clumsy hot off the heels of Hornet's
                        acrobatics. I found myself reaching for the abilities I had learned to rely on and instead found
                        Madeline's simple jump and double jump. But, where I was disappointed with the lack of movement
                        abilities, I was also hardened against difficulty by Silksong and found it much easier to just
                        lock in and finish the game. I didn't 100% the game, though I'm sure I'll be hopping on once in
                        a while to collect strawberries and cassettes.

                    <p> <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong><br /><br />
                        What an experience! 3 months and 71 hrs later I have 100% completed Silksong. There's still a
                        few things to do but those will come later, and a DLC has been announced already. I had an
                        amazing time with the game as I did with Hollow Knight, and I'm glad I went through the majority
                        of it, got two endings, and discovered most secrets before looking a single thing up. Silksong's
                        movement and combat is significantly more fluid and agile than that of Hollow Knight and thus
                        lends itself to a higher level of difficulty. You sprint and flip and bounce and dash, all in
                        one fluid combo that extends through the whole game. The soundtrack perfectly accompanies the
                        highs and lows of your adventure, and often times I find myself walking or standing still to
                        take in the beauty of the world. It's no secret that I love bugs and in Silksong you meet
                        countless amazing bugs with deep character and style. I could go on for a long time talking
                        about Silksong and how good of a time I had with it. I spent a quarter of a year, nearly two
                        work weeks with it. Every minute was a treat.

                    <p> <strong>Sonic Mania</strong><br /><br />
                        Sonic Mania is popularly regarded as a great Sonic game and masterful return to form developed
                        by a small dedicated team. That all may very well be true, it's also true that I'm not a fan of
                        Sonic. I think the character is great, I enjoyed the cartoon when I was young and the new films.
                        The actual gameplay on the other hand I've never really enjoyed, neither in 2D nor in 3D. I
                        decided to give this one a shot because I happen to have it on Epic (I have too many games on
                        Epic and I don't really understand the business model. Is the idea to just throw so much
                        Fortnite money at the PC gamer market that you force Epic into actually breaking in as a game
                        store? Because the store and extra functionality itself is nowhere near Steam. Who knows,
                        anyway...). As expected I didn't really have fun with it and dropped it after like 2 or 3
                        levels.

                        Played about half of the game, which isn't much considering it takes about 90 minutes to beat,
                        and felt overwhelming boredom. Too simple, too basic, maybe it was made for small children.
                        Also, single button controls seem clever until you start playing and realize that it only makes
                        things annoying.

                    <p> <strong>Overgrowth</strong><br /><br />
                        I was first interested in Overgrowth because of the 2014 GDC talk the developer did explaining
                        the
                        player movement coding. I thought his system was so interesting. The game itself is a bit too
                        technical for me honestly, while I found it really fun for many levels, it still feels like a
                        high skill unforgiving competitive game with very little room for error. That's not inherently
                        bad, many games pull it off quite well, but that combined with a very thin story and uninspired
                        scenery makes they experience monotonous. After you kill a few different enemies in increasing
                        numbers and armor and weapons you realize that that's all there is.

                        I didn't intend to play this game. I heard that a new indie horror game had everyone excited and
                        casually ignored it. Then a good friend invited me to play it at his house on a big ol' CRT no
                        less, so I did. There were 4 of us, each voicing a character and me voicing Anya and Curly. We
                        had a great time, laughed our asses off. It surely was not the intended experience but I would
                        not have played it any other way.

                        was peaceful, though a bit stressful at night in the beginning. I ended up catching a bunch of
                        fish, visiting every island, helping some folk and completing the game.

                        Mechs on a chess board, what more can you ask for? Well, maybe it's not the greatest game ever
                        devised but it certainly was very fun. I unlocked some of the other mech teams and unlocked 3
                        out of 4 islands before I stopped playing. I enjoyed the tactical choices and there was
                        definitely more to do and learn.

                        Sometimes a game just doesn't click. This one was such a case. I played it for a bit and didn't
                        really enjoy it. Part of that was UI on the SteamDeck, but most of it was the game's mechanics
                        themselves. Nothing egregious, just didn't interest me.

                        A cute little game about shooting goblins in purgatory while hunting down a witch. It's got a
                        cute art style and fun enough game play but it is a little too simple for repeated loops as a
                        roguelike and it has a memory leak that causes it to turn into a slideshow by mid dungeon. To be
                        fair this is all to be expected from an Early Access game, I do not fault it. I guess I'll just
                        have to pick it up again when it fully releases and see if it has improved.

                        What I have lost in quick reflexes in and abundant free time, I have gained in appreciation of
                        narrative and emotional depth.<br /><br /> Maybe it's all cope because I tried replaying some
                        Super Meat Boy and couldn't get past the first boss which I had beat easily when I was

                        All I knew about this game was a single screenshot of Mae and Gregg on a bike and the vague idea
                        of communism. What I found was a character driven story about the collapse of formerly
                        industrial middle America and the very real personal struggles of people navigating that
                        collapse. I enjoyed talking to each character every day, I enjoyed exploring Possum Springs and
                        taking in the views, I enjoyed finding all the little hidden spaces that humanize a place. The
                        choice to use anthropomorphic animals for the characters counterintuitively humanizes the
                        characters because we cannot see their phenotype, we have to instead pay attention to their
                        thoughts, feelings, actions. The ending, which I won't spoil, was as satisfying as the rest of
                        the story. The guitar mini-game was fun and the music in the game was motivated and
                        beautiful.<br /><br /> Gregg rulz ok.

                    <p> <strong>Metal Gear Rising: Revengence</strong><br /><br />
                        I admit that before playing Metal Gear Rising: Revengence, I was not a fan of Kojima's. Maybe
                        even a hater. Not in the true sense, I really loved the lore and world he made, but I could only
                        ever enjoy it through lore videos and never could get into the games. I think that was partially
                        because the first game of his I tried to play was MGS V which has a 2 hour intro that is mostly
                        cutscenes and by the time I finished it I was already burned out and put the game down. Not to
                        mention that when I first tried MGR I played it on Difficult, died once, and gave up. All that
                        to say I came in with the wrong attitude and expectations. Years passed and I decided to give
                        MGR another chance, if only to see Senator Armstrong. I was patient with the controls, respected
                        the difficulty, sat back and enjoyed the cut scenes and low and behold it all clicked. <br><br>
                        I love this game, it's silly, it's 2010s awesome, the music bangs, the action is over the top,
                        the ideology isn't bad, and the pacing is perfect. When I played engaged with the game how it
                        wanted to be engaged with I realized that the point of the cut scenes was to give you a bit of
                        relief from the action. With this new perspective I am considering playing the other games in
                        the series in release order to actually appreciate the overarching story being told. It really
                        did help that I played it on my Steam Deck instead of my PC, being able to lay comfortably in
                        bed makes the long cutscenes far more palatable.<br><br> PS: I love Jetstream Sam and Senator
                        Armstrong. Blade Wolf is the goodest boy.

                        good character customization system and an actual plot and characters, but neither of those
                        things is the point of the game and they have no real effect on it. I was disappointed with the
                        actual gameplay. It's relatively shallow, repetitive, and mostly grinds. There is little
                        feedback on actions taken and basically no need to do complex moves, other than the score.
                        Famous 3D skating games succeed when they provide many challenges of different types: Speed,

                        worlds and did not feel compelled to continue playing.

                        I am a huge fan of 5th generation graphics. I didn't play video games back then so I don't have
                        nostalgia for the style, I just think it looks really nice. In the same way that photographs
                        didn't make the painting obsolete, realistic 3D graphics do not make crunchy low poly graphics
                        obsolete. That being said I don't love everything about that era of games: the low FPS, the
                        pop-in, and specifically the PS1's warble.<br /><br /> Retro 3D game preamble completed, Need
                        for Speed III: Hot Pursuit is really fun! Looks amazing, sounds real good, hard to drive but
                        once it clicks it clicks. At first I was bumping off the walls and crashing horribly in the
                        hazards, but after some practice I was sticking to the line and drifting just the right amount.
                        Highly enjoyable!

                    <p> <strong>Bad North</strong><br /><br />
                        It seems a little too simple at first. Just move your guys to kill their guys. The more of your
                        guys the better. But as you go on from island to island the complexity and the fun begins to
                        layer on. You start realizing that the skills, items, money, power ups, all have a place and a
                        use. You start to realize there there are more optimal ways to fight. <br /><br /> By the time I
                        felt I really got the hang of Bad North, I was quick switching units, shields first to absorb
                        projectiles and charges then spears to do damage, I was putting spear-men at the top of stairs
                        and slopes and at the mouth of choke-points to get an advantage, I was taking pot shots and
                        retreating with my archers. The game is so active and dynamic, the stakes are high enough that
                        you don't want to lose and low enough that you are confident experimenting and discovering new
                        tactics.<br /><br /> I really enjoyed playing Bad North and will definitely be coming back to it
                        once in a while.

                        Let me start off by saying that I did in fact play this game for more than 20 minutes, but I did
                        not beat it. It's a Vampire Survivor like with pretty good gameplay but not anything I expect to
                        be replaying any time soon. It's good at what it set out to do but seeing as I have not played
                        Vampire Survivor, I've got no idea if it's as good at what seems like the gold standard.

                        BPM is really odd in that I understood it to be a rhythm game like Hi-Fi Rush so I started out
                        trying to get all my actions to line up to the rhythm and I struggled. Then I gave up on that
                        and just played it as a regular FPS, shooting and jumping and dashing whenever I want and I did
                        much better. I had a fun time with it, but with it's main gimmick so weak I'm not hooked.

                    <p> <strong>BattleBit Remastered</strong><br /><br />
                        Impressive how much a three man team can achieve when concerned only with good gameplay and not
                        worrying about the best graphics or the most aggressive monetization or advertising. It's
                        especially poignant as BattleBit Remastered released around the same time the newest Battlefield
                        game flopped. This, and the success of many other indie games, as well as the slew of recent AAA
                        flops and layoffs is a clear sign of the readjustment of the industry. Interest free money is
                        gone, the period of massive growth is over, labor is up, and the video game corporations are
                        being out competed by solo devs and indie studios.<br /><br /> That all being said, and as much
                        fun as I had with this game, at time of writing it seems to have been abandoned by the
                        developers which is actually a bit of a rare case when it comes to success indie games. AAA
                        corporation on the other hand are more than happy to shutter whole studios making widely popular
                        games simply because profits weren't high enough.

                        I think this game may be too retro for me. I wasn't playing games when the first Metro games
                        were popular so I don't have any nostalgia for this. Unfortunately, it did not click for me.

                        Chivalry 2 was much like Chivalry 1, a great time. I played it for a while longer than I did the
                        first and found it to just be an overall improved experience on all fronts. The combat is
                        probably the best I have played aside from Souls games, and that's saying a lot. Who knows how
                        long this game will still be running, but I do recommend it for those interested. Although, the
                        player base is much more experienced now and there are very few new players so the overall
                        difficulty has increased markedly. That is the fate of all multiplayer games of this sort it
                        seems.

                        for the difficulty mainly due to the clunky interface and slow time to get back in the fight. I
                        have played hours of this game and enjoyed them but I have to put it down.

                        FromSoft nails it again with an amazing game. It was difficult from start to finish and all the
                        better for it. Every time I struggled against a boss and finally figured them out and beat them
                        felt amazing, and returning to old areas only to find that I was easily beating old foes with
                        little effort was very rewarding. I must admit that I stopped playing the game right at the
                        final boss. Maybe someday I will come back to it and truly complete it. I think my mistake was
                        taking too long of a break after getting stuck and losing my muscle memory. Regardless of not
                        completing the game, I still enjoyed every moment, even the repeated deaths. I vividly remember
                        every zone and boss, which is a testament to the quality of the craftsmanship.

                        A cute little game kill a few hours. None of the puzzles were stumpers but the vibes were clean
                        and it didn't overstay its welcome. I also played the bonus levels and found them to be about
                        the same. I first learned about this game from House of Cards. That did not age well, but the
                        game was good enough to survive that hit.

                        I played this game in short bursts on my phone over the course of a week. I think that is really
                        what it was designed for, I can't image sitting down at a computer and focusing on it. The
                        mechanics have enough depth to be engrossing until the end of the game. I slew the spire and
                        unlocked all 4 characters, though The Silent was my favorite and was the one I used to beat the
                        game. Overall a very enjoyable experience.

                        I had a passing interest in the game and finally decided to pick it up after Jacob Geller made a
                        video about it. It has such an amazing progression, from the episodic aging to the true ending.
                        I started out as I assume most do, running around getting hit, dying, barely making it through
                        levels. But as I got better at the game I slowly mastered the flow of bait and punish, as well
                        as the rush and strike. I easily made it through large portions of the game untouched and
                        finally finished the game first in the bad ending and then the good. The bonus stages were also
                        a blast. In a strange turn of events, this game caused me to want to play Sekiro. I needed more
                        of that beautiful parrying gameplay. <br /> Side note: I played on Linux and experienced a GPU
                        memory leak. The game would get progressively slower until it became a slide show and I had to
                        reboot it. I finally found the cause in one of the graphics settings and it was fixed.

                        I have to admit I was a huge hater when this game came out. I had absolutely no hype for it,
                        didn't watch any trailers and new very little about it. So to me, all I saw was a game
                        struggling and floundering, and developer promises broken and a poor product sold at full price.
                        I wrote the game off and moved on. Fast forward to the 2.1 patch. On a whim I broke my promise
                        of never playing this game and bought it and the DLC on sale. Little did I know the game would
                        become one of my favorites of all time. I think it really helped that I didn't have any
                        expectation for the game, I know a lot of people expected an RPG with dialogue and decisions and
                        character progression, and of course were disappointed with a mostly linear game. Meanwhile I
                        came in expecting to shoot a bunch of goons for about 10 hours and was happily surprised with
                        100 hrs of beautiful realistic and well acted characters, a compelling story, and very fun
                        gameplay. Johnny Silverhand lives rent free in my head.

                        in fear, and having a goofy time. The game itself served as a good enough medium which is all I
                        think it was ever meant to be.

                        I got BG3 months after its first release and after much praise from my friends. It wasn't on my
                        radar and I didn't plan on getting it, and because I never watch any ads or trailers, I really
                        didn't even know what it was other than it's association with the first two Baldur's Gate games
                        and the DnD world. I was pleasantly surprised and engrossed when I finally started playing it. I
                        made a half-elf rogue, quickly gravitated to Shadowheart (respeced as paladin), Karlach
                        (respeced as fighter), and Wyll (kept as warlock). I also played plenty with Lae'zel and
                        Astarion. I never played with the wizard or the druid, they just didn't click with me. I hated
                        the wizard so much that I never even did his quests or talked to him. I loved the characters,
                        and the story was a good vehicle for them. I helped Shadowheart get over her trauma, got Karlach
                        her revenge, freed Wyll, and got a satisfying ending.

                        This was the first Armored Core game I played. I don't do hype as a rule and I avoid all
                        trailers and advertising so this game did not pop into my radar until release day. On a whim and
                        knowing little about Armored Core except for some videos about the first few I decided to buy
                        it. I'm glad I did because for the next few weeks I played it to completion and had a fine time
                        doing so. I love how mechanical and heavy it is, while maintaining an incredible level of
                        fluidity and control. I've always loved mechs, but compared to Pacific Rim and Gundam, this
                        style is by far my favorite. Not so heavy as to be an oversized Rockem Sockem robot, not so
                        agile as to be space acrobatics. Very mechanical and real. I do want to check out the Battletech
                        video games to see how they feel in comparison. This game was in fact the inspiration for me
                        buying my Battletech minis.

                        The aesthetic and presentation are on point but the gameplay is lacking. It may just be that I
                        am not into boomer shooters but I often find myself either lost or bored of the repetitive
                        gameplay. It may be accurate for a boomer shooter to have generic enemy AI and a simplistic
                        world design but it doesn't excuse the lack of fun. If it weren't for the presentation and
                        general polish, I would say this is a mediocre game getting propped up by the 40K IP.

                        because I would just think "what would a cat do" and inevitable the game would reward that
                        behavior. Wonderful.

                        by the end of 100+ hours of playing I had beat every single boss solo and completed the game. I
                        really enjoyed my time with it, as is apparent from how long I spent playing. Obviously this
                        took months as I do not have as much free time as others. For the record I played as a samurai
                        and I used the starting gear through the whole game.

                        largest as can be seen in my critters page. But it always feels wrong to observe an animal in
                        captivity, clearly they are not meant to be where we have put them, and so they will never
                        behave how they truly would in their natural environment. ABZÛ attempted, and I would argue
                        succeeded, in letting you unobtrusively observe aquatic environments up close and personal. It
                        will never be at good as deep sea diving, but I don't intend on ever doing that so this is more
                        than good enough. Highly recommend to all.

                        netcode and melee hit registration. I would not recommend it now, but it was fun with friends

                        Steam library and decided to give it another shot. That was the beginning of what became an over
                        %100 completion run and some speed runs. I really love this game, it just sounds and looks and
                        plays so right. You may have noticed that I liked the game so much that I themed the whole

                        played at the perfect time to enjoy great lobbies of mixed skill and new techniques being
                        discovered all the time. If you figured something out you would dominate multiple games until
                        people caught up with you which really encourage creativity. At first we played it like a
                        shooter, moving normally and going for regular kills. After a while though everyone adapted and
                        it was no longer enough. We then learned all the movement tech, the portal physics, and great
                        team communication to get a much needed edge on our opponents. It's a shame the game when out of
                        style, replaced by the much inferior and now dead Halo Infinite.

                        Corporate work sure is a slog. Aggro Crab's going under is a cute delve into an assortment of
                        modern corporate jobs and their pitfalls as formulated under capitalism. The goal of each
                        "dungeon" is to be the boss (my favorite of which is the Caffiend). The weapon mechanic keep the
                        game feeling fresh and the writing is very human. The game is limited in it's economic analysis
                        by not pushing for unionization, which would actually help protect the Joblins and other
                        workers. Instead the game essentially stops at criticizing startups, the gig economy, modern
                        dating, and crypto. All valid criticisms but somewhat hollow without the underlying cause of
                        capitalism being analyzed. Regardless I loved the game, completed it and played a bit of the
                        infinite dungeon before happily retiring it.

                        for the Zionist occupation of Palestine, and we know where he stands on that. So what can I now
                        say about the game? Can I truly sit here and tell you that at the time I played it, and for
                        years afterwards I thought it was amazing and that it easily was one of my favorite games of all
                        time? Would that wash the genocide flavored taste out of your mouth? I can't separate art from
                        artist, can you? Art is inherently political, it must be. Even when it tries to be apolitical it
                        defacto supports the status quo by failing to challenge it. The Last of Us isn't apolitical,
                        it's the product of so much sadistic torture and deliberate torture for the sake of the empire.

                    <p> <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong><br /><br />
                        Ghost of Tsushima is easily one of the best games I have ever played. I first played it on
                        normal but after about an hour I turned the difficulty to max and it clicked. The whole point of
                        samurai and ninja is the long periods of calm punctuated by explosions of highly lethal
                        violence. Turning the difficulty up made it so that if I didn't make every strike and basically
                        not get hit I would die, which compliments this game's aesthetic and theme as well as its
                        mechanics.<br /><br /> Both stealth and action are viable so I hunted in hiding until I was
                        discovered when I went loud. I was so immersed that I would clean my sword, bow, and play a song
                        after every fight because it just felt right to pay respect, especially after beating important
                        characters. There was nothing forcing me to do that, nor was there any reward, but it was what
                        Jin would have done.<br /><br />
                        Playing as Jin Sakai, exploring the beautiful island of Tsushima, fighting against the mongols
                        and
                        traitor samurai, living in that world, it was all such a great experience.

                        was really into Apex back when it first came out. The match making was great, characters were
                        fresh, and the gameplay was really fun. I admit I didn't win very many times but I did have a
                        great time. It became less fun as people got really good at the game and were still matched with
                        me. I don't have much time to practice so I don't get all that good, and I'm old. Cope. Either
                        way I dropped off the game. I'm glad I played it when I did.

                        I played Genshin Impact instead of studying for a math exam. I was pretty hooked for about a
                        week, right around launch. Traversal was good enough and for a mobile game it was fairly
                        impressive. It was still a shallow gacha game and I soon lost interest when the grind set in.

                        flow state of running fast and getting as many kills as possible without getting hit. There's
                        something really sweet about seeing the skull number go up. Maybe I would do better if I read
                        the item and ability descriptions but no, that's for nerds, and I am an entirely different kind
                        of nerd.

                        The mechanics of Shadow Tactics are very well designed and executed. The game expects you to
                        save-scum to pull off perfect kills and even shows you how to do it in the beginning of the game
                        and has is as permanent UI elements at the top of the screen. The reason this works so well is
                        because you can play very quickly and sloppily and just finish the game but it wont be as
                        satisfying as pulling off the perfect 5-man combo kills and super sneaky moves. The better you
                        play, the more rewards you get as well, which further incentivizes perfect play. The story is
                        also really good and by the end I was getting genuinely attacked and moved by the characters and
                        their lives.

                        choices that affect them. I loved every bit. Then I played it again and found even more to love.
                        This game and it's amazing writing has concretely changed me as a person.

                        This game is likely the best detective game ever made. I'll never be able to play it for the
                        first time again which is the greatest tragedy. Using only two colors, no animations, and
                        relying almost entirely on sound and a moment's freeze frame, the game sets up sub-mystery after
                        sub-mystery all building towards the overall mystery and plot. Easily one of the best games of
                        all time.

                        the table top game. The Space Marine video game on the other hand was a blast through and
                        through. So much so that I have played it start to finish 3 times, and beat it on the hardest
                        difficulty. Feels and plays and looks and sounds so satisfyingly how Space Marine should feel

                    <p> <strong>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</strong><br /><br />
                        I love the lord of the rings films. They hit the perfect spot for me and have shaped much of my
                        early conception of fantasy, that I later developed further as I encountered more ideas. When I
                        finally got my hands on Shadow of Mordor I was delighted to find that it was a great and
                        memorable game, especially with its innovative (and unfortunately patented) nemesis system. I
                        vividly remember the opening scenes, the first time using celebrimbor's powers, the rencounters
                        with orks that bested you and rose up in the ranks as a reward. I loved the long arkham style
                        melee combos, the perfectly aimed slowmo arrow shots, the sprinting and parkour, and the
                        stealthy brutalities. I ended up 100% completing the game and coming away happy to have
                        experienced it.

                        Perhaps the only management game in this 2D side view perspective. It reminded me of the old
                        Kairosoft games so I played it for a bit. An enjoyable experience, perhaps needing a bit more
                        depth and character.

                        and the shooting and swordplay are pretty good as well. I didn't end up playing much relative to
                        what is expected from MMOs but from what I did play I did have a really good time.

                        cousin's house ages ago. I was drawn to it by the stylized animations and very emotive designs.
                        Even the tank felt organic. I eventually got MS3 on steam and played it though one afternoon and
                        while it could never recapture the feeling of feeding a machine quarters after a day at the
                        pool, it did scratch the itch for great design.

                        OlliOlli2 is a simple 2D skating game that is pretty effective. While it cannot complete with 3D

                        tricks is effective and fun.

                        The beginning was kind of boring but the world was much better. I didn't engage much with the
                        main quest, instead I talked to who ever I found and followed the flow of the adventure. I did
                        eventually make my way back to the main quest, though I had little interest in it and eventually
                        saved the water supply. Not amazing, not horrible.

                        I have many great memories of playing this game at its peak. Before the sequel came out and
                        split the player base, it was a vibrant game full of all the people who weren't interested in
                        Call of Duty, Battlefield, or Arma. So many amazing clutch moments as the last one alive,
                        killing player after player and barely holding the ground. Something about the way the game
                        looked and played was so pure. That's all gone now but I'm glad I played it when I did.

                        enjoyed our time, and because we were playing pretty early into the game's release we were able
                        to get pretty good and have a lot of wins. The summer ended and we all moved on but it was a
                        good time.

                        My two best friends and I sat in my room. I had the game on my old laptop and I had printed a
                        copy of the manual for us to use. We took turns trying to diffuse the bomb. We laughed, we
                        screamed, we stressed, we clutched. The longer we played the more serious we got, the more
                        confident. The bombs got harder and we naturally developed a shorthand language to identify the
                        modules, the actions necessary to solve them, and the best order of operations. It was a
                        wonderful time.

                        mid 2010s so of course it was a zombie game and a really fun one being as simple as it was. I
                        ended up completing it, and enjoyed it enough to pick up again once or twice more since.

                        This was probably my first encounter with the immersive sim genre. I was relatively young and
                        unused to a high level of creative thought and problem solving while playing video games.
                        Fortunately, Human Revolution doesn't have much of that. I went through the game upgrading as I
                        wished, shooting everyone dead who opposed me, and generally taking the default path. I explored
                        and problem solves and talked of course, but I was never challenged to really think outside the
                        box or lured to try something creative. I later learned that Human Revolution was not a great
                        example of the genre, instead that honor rested with the original Deus Ex and with the new Prey.

                        This is the one Call of Duty game that I played any significant amount of, finished it multiple
                        times, played way too much of the multiplayer. It was fun. It was really fun. I have fond
                        memories of the late nights on Rust and Airport. I had only barely noticed the imperialism, the
                        American propaganda, the anti-arab, Islamophobia, first-worldist jingoism but I was nowhere near
                        actually understanding it. It was only much later that I revisited the game and began to
                        understand the connection between the developers and the US military-industrial complex. Maybe
                        the most insidious aspect of Call of Duty is that the gameplay has been good enough to mask the
                        politics underneath.

                        We sat on the living room floor of his grandma's house. Everything smelled of cigarette smoke.
                        He took out the Borderlands 2 CD and popped in something else. The next minutes where filled
                        with helicopters, grappling hooks, parachutes, and guns. The physics blew me away like I had so
                        easily blown away so many tropical goons with rocket like gas canisters. That night I downloaded
                        a copy of Just Cause 2, set it to the lowest settings and minimal resolution, and played through
                        the night. I "liberated" that island. In hindsight I would say that I destabilized that island,
                        wrecked it to bits without regard for "collateral damage" (an insane and dehumanizing term).

                        Definitely the best Borderlands game in the series. The first game was very rough and I didn't
                        play it much at all. The others in the series went overboard and by then I was too old for that
                        type of humor. Borderlands 2 hit just the right kind of tone at the right time in my life so it
                        just clicked. My first ever cosplay was that on a borderland psycho. The best part of the outfit
                        was my hand made <a href="crafts.html#crafts_borderlands_psycho_mask">mask</a>, which survives
                        to this day.

                    <p> <strong>Terraria</strong><br /><br />
                        I started playing Terraria way back when it was very early in it's development. So far back that
                        I remember editing the regex to give myself the exclusive pet rabbit on my totally legit copy
                        installed on my brother's laptop because my computer couldn't event run it. I remember having
                        the wiki open while playing to help me figure out how to do the more advanced things,
                        consistently checking for content updates, playing deep into the night. When I got a steam
                        account this was the second game I purchased on it for $5 during a steam summer sale. The first
                        game was FTL just a day prior. That was all the money I could spend on games and I was
                        satisfied. I played Terraria on and off since then, each time creating a new world and making
                        the same NPC hotel and hellevator and all the rest. I still prefer Corruption to Crimson and I
                        barely ever make it past the Wall of Flesh. This game still has a fond place in my heart and a
                        spot reserved in my hard drive.

                        It was winter though it was not very cold. My laptop sat on piece of wood to keep it off the
                        carpet. I lay on my stomach and watched as the logo appeared and the theme song played.
                        Unmodded, no GPU, barely running at a slideshow unless I dropped all the setting and the
                        resolution, but it was glorious. I played it endlessly that winter. I did do board and sword and
                        stealth archer. I did watch Skyrim comedy videos and Letsplays. I remember one of my favorite
                        youtubers at the time, a very small channel I wont name, encountering the frost troll on the way
                        up to the Throat of the World. I remember the bugs and crashes. I played through it all. Later
                        on I revisited Skyrim after it's last major updates and DLC. I played through the dawnguard and
                        hearthfire, though I never cared for dragonborn. I spent way too much time the Nexus looking for
                        and installing mods, probably longer than I did playing. It was a good time. The game wasn't
                        perfect, not even close, but for a child it was a good time.

                        LAB over a montage of beautiful cars racing, crashing, and wiping out. I first played Flatout in
                        middle school computer class. We would quickly finish our classwork and boot up either Flatout,
                        TrackMania, or Robot Arena. Of course our favorite mode of Flatout was the demolition derby, in
                        fact, I don't think we ever did a single race. Having replayed it again recently I was
                        immediately transported to that computer class. We never did learn anything about computers

                    <p> <strong>Dwarf Fortress</strong><br /><br />
                        I have been playing Dwarf Fortress on and off since around 2010. Back then I neither understood
                        nor could run the game effectively, but I was still enamored by the possibility and the stories
                        people created in the game. I followed development and bought the game as soon as it released on
                        Steam because I felt the need to give back to the game devs who had created such a wonderful
                        game and shared it with the world for free for nearly as long as I have been alive. Now with
                        native graphics, mouse controls and all the rest it is one of the greatest games of all time.

                    <p> <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</strong><br /><br />
                        Needless to say, after loving Phantom Hourglass, I had to play Spirit Tracks as soon as it was
                        released. Off the bat, trains and the overworld theme are incredible! Not only is Link a train
                        conductor, he's accompanied by Zelda as a ghost who possesses a suit of armor. A side note, the
                        way that the Zelda franchise is treated is so smart, keep the mono-myth, shuffle everything
                        else. There's a Link, a Zelda, a Ganon, but other than that who knows? Train, boat, wolf,
                        motorcycle, each game is fresh and beautiful.

                    <p> <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</strong><br /><br />
                        The Phantom Hourglass was the first Zelda game I played and the first I finished and it's the
                        reason I love The Legend of Zelda now. I remember playing this game on my DS and being totally
                        enamored by it, the fluid stylus controls, the cartoony visuals, the beautiful music which is
                        all ingrained in my brain and I still listen to to this day. I sailed with Linebeck, delved the
                        Temple of the Ocean King, and explored islands and traded and helped people. I can vividly
                        recall the ghost ship, the Like Likes, the seagull that follows your ship. I am glad I
                        experienced this game when I did.

                    <p> <strong>Age of Empires II</strong><br /><br />
                        Age of Empires II has a special place in my heart. I haven't played it in a long time and I was
                        never particularly good at it but it is one of the oldest games I remember playing, alongside
                        minesweeper and pinball. I absolutely love the art, the way the units move, the carefully
                        designed buildings. The sound effects are ingrained into my brain. The villager spawning breath,
                        the enemy contact bells, the quips, the wololo. I'm no good at RTS games, I don't have the will
                        to get good, but AoE2 will always be one of my favorite games of all time.

                        I use to think that I didn't horror games, but after playing Carrion I realized that I just
                        didn't like being the victim of horror games. When instead playing as a formless mass of
                        vitriolic meat, I am much more at ease. Who amongst us isn't a formless mass of vitriolic meat
                        once in a while? Anyway, I enjoyed a quiet summer day morning playing Carrion and left feeling
                        it had lasted exactly as long as it should have.

                        A surprising good game loop with tight controls. I would play a few levels, die, and immediately
                        go back in for more. It's a very simple idea that really shines due to execution and polish.

                        place, and picked my preferred ending based on my decisions. I was moved by my time in the game
                        and I really look forward to playing Citizen Sleeper 2.

                        Climate change has struck but instead of global warming, it's an ice age. You find yourself
                        leading a group of survivors as they attempt to stay warm and fed in icy crater. The premise is
                        already very cool, similar to Snowpiercer which I loved. I'd like to see more grounded fiction
                        dealing with climate change and the experiences of people living through it. Frostpunk balances
                        city building with narrative and exploration in a way that makes a genre I don't usually engage
                        with actually really fun. City builders always felt aimless to me, probably because I'm not the
                        kind of person to make my own fun in video games. Frostpunk instead gives you harsh deadlines
                        and severe consequences for every individual failure, along with a great presentation and theme.

                        An indie classic and a damn hard one at that. I've never beat it. Got close a few times, reached
                        the last ship, did a little damage, then exploded. Maybe I'll fare better now that I am much
                        older than the first time I played it. Fun fact: this is the very first game I ever purchased on
                        Steam! Before even Terraria.

                        I must admit first and foremost that I am not a space fan. I know many people who are fascinated
                        by the big empty void of mostly nothing and follow rocket and satellite news very closely and
                        have Lego shuttles as decor. I am not one of them. I respect space, I think it's neat, good
                        stuff has come out of space but I have always been a land loving person.<br /><br /> That all
                        being said, I had a good time with Kerbal Space Program. The rocket building mechanics are easy
                        to understand and hard to master, the orbital mechanics are accurate and fun to set up and
                        execute, overall it was good.<br /><br /> I did stop playing as soon as I could get rockets in
                        orbit and docking consistently, and landing on the moon. Once I was able to do that there just
                        want anything else left to do that interested me.

                        having fun but new comers will struggle to get good quick enough.

                        I played MTG with friends all through high school. It was expensive, especially for a broke
                        student, but it felt worth it. I also played Arena, which is the video game version of the card
                        game and it's legitimately very good. Of course it isn't a perfect game because it is free, card
                        packs can be earned or purchased with real money, and only certain sets are included. An ideal
                        MTG video game would be purchased full price, include all sets released up to date, and future
                        sets would be purchased as DLC. This, of course, will never be made because it directly
                        conflicts with one of the most lucrative table top games ever made. One can dream.

                        I never play horror games but this one is something different. Maybe it's more horror themed
                        action? Whatever the category, it is one of my favorite games, especially having played it the
                        first time on the hardest difficulty. I got into a flow where I knew exactly how many bullets
                        each one of my guns had and how much time I had on my air filters. No UI, extreme difficulty,
                        amazing game.

                        I can't say I was any good at this game or really engaged with it on the level that it requires.
                        There are people out there who fully immerse themselves in the numbers and logic of the game and
                        explore all the mechanics, unfortunately I don't have the time to invest. I played it a while
                        and enjoyed what I did but was often a bit aimless and confused. I think it's definitely worth a
                        try if you're into these kinds of games but I have learned that I am not.

                    <p> <strong>The Ascent</strong><br /><br />
                        The world of the ascent is beautifully detailed visually and uses depth and far off backgrounds
                        to imply a much larger space than is actually playable. But while the visuals are nice and the
                        combat and gameplay overall are good, the game is disappointing. One of the core aspects of the
                        cyberpunk genre is the exploration of humanity. The robots and explosions and tech are cool and
                        great, but without the fundamental interrogation of real human existence it all rings hollow. It
                        seems odd to say this about a twin-stick shooter, and I agree, not all games have to be deep
                        introspection. The issue is that the gun-play isn't all that deep so a void is left that should
                        have been filled with a moving story.<br /><br /> I enjoyed my time with the game and got pretty
                        far into it before putting it down.

                        the next step and was likely hampered by it's too-childish aesthetic.

                        World War 1 games are relatively rare compared to WW2. The guns are slow, the lines are static,
                        and the war is pointless (actually it was a war for imperial power and control over the
                        colonies). Verdun pulls of a WW1 game by leaning into these aspects. 2 large teams fight over
                        control of trencher in seemingly endless waves. You pop up, take a shot, and hopefully come down
                        again without dying. When the moment is right everyone charges forward to take the enemy
                        trenches which is a bloody close quarters affair.
