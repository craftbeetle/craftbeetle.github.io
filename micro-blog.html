                    The idea of evil races in fiction is hot garbage. Set aside the incredibly racist roots of this
                    idea, the concept of an evil race flattens the narrative possible of the story.<br><br>

                    Why are they evil? Because that's just how they are.<br><br>

                    Evil races can only be exterminated, therefore whatever story has an evil race is a story of
                    genocide and ethnic cleansing.

                    AI is making this worse while trying to solve it. Even before image and video AI, articles all over
                    the internet are now AI written then summarized once more using AI, and that AI was trained on AI
                    written articles.<br><br>

                    All my life I have avoided horror. Now I am engaging with it seriously for the purpose of running a
                    Mothership game for my friends.

                    I have learned many programs in my life so far, some I have learned very well. But I have also lost
                    access to some of them due to price or updates or other reasons. Now I am reluctant to start
                    learning anything that isn't FOSS (Free Open Source Software), because FOSS is the only software I
                    not only trust with my privacy and security but also with my time and effort.

                    Sometimes I wonder how many people see my website. I've intentionally not implemented any way to
                    know so that I don't get obsessed with number go up.

                    I have 20+ blog posts in various states of writing and waiting to be posted. I should probably
                    finish one already.

                    I nearly all my pictures with my Android phone. In pro mode I set my ISO as low as it will go (50),
                    my shutter speed as high as possible (1/12000 to 1/2000), pull focus close, and use flash. This
                    makes the background very dark if not completely black and the subject is bright and in focus.

                    I use Instagram on mobile browser. I don't have in installed because the browser version is
                    horrendous. It's really bad. Buggy, barely registered likes, laggy, you name it. <br><br>

                    And that's exactly how I like it. Only by crippling the experience so much is the skinner box robbed
                    of its power.

                    Still mulling this whole micro blog thing over. On the one hand, small thoughts have a place to
                    live. On the other hand, why share small thoughts?<br><br>
                    Small thoughts are human.

                    I use <a href="https://wildflowersearch.org" target="_blank">WildflowerSearch</a> basically every
                    time I upload a plant picture. Even when I identify it using another method, I still verify on
                    WildflowerSearch.

                    This is the year of the backlog. I plan on not buying a single new game and only playing video games
                    I already have. <br><br>

                    Current backlog: 208 games.
