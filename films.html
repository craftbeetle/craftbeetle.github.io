                My thoughts on the films I have watched. This list only goes back a few years but in that time I
                have watched a lot of movies. I don't have a lot to say about every movie, sometimes it's just
                something I watched a few years back.

                        <strong>Children Of Shatila</strong><br /><br />
                        Another documentary film by the maker of Frontiers of Dreams and Fears, Children of Shatila
                        follows survivors of the Zionist massacre of Sabra and Shatila and their descendants,
                        specifically two children named Issa and Farah.<br><br>
                        We follow the human toll of the continues evils of the Zionist project and are reminded once
                        more that this did not start with Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. The massacre as Sabra and Shatila
                        were conducted on 16–18 September 1982, and they are not unique in colonial history.<br><br>
                        All colonized peoples have a Sabra and Shatila, and thus we are bound together to resist these
                        evils and end imperialism once and for all.

                        To understand the path forward in the mission of Palestinian liberation and global
                        anti-colonialism, we must necessary study those who came before us, so that we can effectively
                        pick up where they left off.<br><br>

                        This film is a direct communication from the thinkers who came before us, most famously Ghassan
                        Kanafani, as they outline for us their current conditions and they goals. Watching this film
                        gave me a sense of continuity and duty. People came before me and lived, struggled, gave a lot
                        and in many cases gave everything for the liberation movement and our duty is to continue their
                        work.

                        I laughed a few times. I found some moments funny, the movie as a whole was entertaining. It
                        stayed safely at the very surface of the underlying politics of the plot. Of course not every
                        movie is going to be a fundamental dissection of class, even I'm not that boring. I enjoyed it
                        but found it too light and fleeting, too mundane. Maybe that was the point.<br><br>
                        It's as if the movie was made to be referenced by youtube essayists 20 years later. Presentism,
                        I know.

                        <strong>Superman (2025)</strong><br /><br />
                        I had no intention of watching this film until my friends, and basically everyone on the
                        internet, swore up and down that it was a pro-Palestine film. I still didn't believe them
                        because how can such a massive franchise so deeply imbedded in Hollywood be anything like that.
                        My friends fought me tooth and nail and finally made me watch it and I was pleasantly surprised.
                        It's as clear as could be without being explicit. Sure, the invading country speaks
                        Serbo-Croatian, but other than that it's clear cut that Boravia is the Israel stand in and
                        Jarhanpur is the Palestine stand in. The Borovians have tanks, guns, US made weapons, and are
                        "strong US allies", and the Jarhanpur has sticks and machete's to defend themselves with.
                        Boravians are white, Jarhanpuris are brown. The film is not about Russia and Ukraine (obviously)
                        because if it were, the US would be on the side of the smaller country being invaded. It's also
                        not about the Bosnian genocide because it wouldn't have been two completely different looking
                        people.<br><br>

                        The movie was really good. As a Superman movie it was incredibly satisfying and
                        showed that his whole deal is how do I stop the disaster without losing even a squirrel's life.
                        Superman is naive, and powerful, and kind, and above all he has a clear moral compass. I have to
                        admit I nearly cried.<br><br>

                        We must remember that in real life there is no Superman. There are
                        normal people, struggling, protesting, boycotting, fighting, dying, suing, sabotaging, striking,
                        delaying, speaking, singing, crying, donating, and doing the real liberation working in a
                        million other ways. It was really nice to see Green Lantern give the "Zionists" the middle
                        finger, it was cathartic, but it was not real. Don't allow the film's happy ending lull you into
                        passivity. In the real world we all have to be Superman.

                        <strong>Frontiers of Dreams and Fears</strong><br /><br />
                        We often hear and read about Palestinian children after something horrible has been done to them
                        by Israelis. It's far less common for us to see them living life as it is in Palestine and in
                        the refugee camps in Lebanon. This film follows two 14 year old Palestinian girls as they live
                        what is considered a normal life as a Palestinian refugee. They're so normal. I see my cousins
                        in them. They do homework, have friends, talk about boys, eat, laugh, cry. Of course I knew
                        this, but I hadn't seen anyone talk about it or show it. Always we see Palestinian children in
                        the midst of Zionist made, US funded famine and genocide. The film follows as the girls travel
                        to the barb wired border and meet other Palestinians, the scenes made me cry. All the while the
                        Zionist presence threatens life. Near the end of the movie the Intifada begins and we see the
                        reality. The cowardly blood lusting Israelis shooting at children throwing rocks. The movie is
                        set in 2006. Two decades later, we still fight for Palestinian liberation.

                        <strong>Leila and the Wolves</strong><br /><br />
                        Leila takes us back in time to the struggle against the British and the Zionists in Palestine
                        and Lebanon. She shows the audience the role that women played in the struggle, a whole often
                        diminished or ignored all together. The film does not deride the men who fought and died, in
                        fact the film does not focus on them at all. They are acknowledged, mentioned, and recognized
                        but they are not the focus. Instead we see how the women sacrificed all they had, risked life
                        and limb to spy, smuggle weapons, misdirect enemy troops, and fight the enemy head on. There is
                        no romanticism. It's ugly, and painful, and real.<br><br>
                        The film is interspersed with film and photographs from the real events portrayed, and was
                        filmed in dangerous places. Women have always been an integral part of the struggle, and we do
                        ourselves a great disservice by not remembering that.

                        sense and you wish you could tell the characters. I see why this film is held in such high
                        regard, Carpenter killed it.

                        Sometimes the best way to expose evil is to let it speak for itself. The documentary film makers
                        interview old people who witnessed, perpetrated, or were victims of the Nakba. You might think
                        that this isn't a both sides issue, that Israeli terrorists shouldn't be given any space to
                        speak. I thought so too until I heard them speak. No remorse. Cold monsters that continue to be
                        proud of their actions. They acknowledge the Nakba is genocide and they stand by it. Israelis
                        are truly a vile people.

                        Phenomenal film making. The editing with the split screen and multiple views, the spacing and

                        loved how normal their looked. No one was runway model attractive, no one had quips, it was all
                        done so well.

                        Freedom of speech is a right in the United States, and like all rights and laws it is applied
                        selectively and in ways that benefit those in power. We see this again in the Palestine
                        Exception, free speech is great until students in the United States decide to use their voices
                        to protest genocide, then they are violently shut down. The film shows the encampments and the
                        reaction of academia to peaceful protest.

                        The Zionists steal your home, murder your family, ethnically cleanse the land, wage genocide on
                        your people, and occasionally offer you the opportunity to visit home (you must pay them for the
                        privilege of course and purchase their goods while you are there.) do you take it offer? It
                        might be the only time you ever get to see your stolen home. You might be martyred by them
                        before the next chance, before liberation. This impossible question is at the center of the
                        documentary short film The Eid Gift. The answer may appear clear now but the reality is far more
                        difficult.

                        <strong>Salt of this Sea</strong><br /><br />
                        It's one thing to read about Palestine, talk to Palestinians, watch the news of Palestinian
                        events, it's a whole other thing to experience Palestinian stories. The film may be fictional,
                        but the checkpoints, the harassment, the abuse, the danger, the dispossession, the frustration
                        and anger and pain. That is all real.<br /><br />
                        Salt of this Sea follows a Palestinian women as she returns to her homeland and finds it filled
                        with a hostile and brutal occupier. Her mobility, language, appearance, love, and mere existence
                        is an act of rebellion against the tyrannical apartheid state. You see plainly the Banality of
                        Evil as everyone from TSA to illegal occupier participates in the oppression. Even those who
                        seem outwardly progressive are shown to be simply acting the part in the shallowest sense.

                        This movie felt like three movies trimmed down and senselessly smashed together, because it was.
                        It made absolutely no sense and having never watched Digimon I was extra lost. But the dialogue
                        was hilarious and the theme song goes so hard it almost makes me want to watch the recent uncut
                        re-release with new English dub.

                        This is a surprisingly bad movie, it's not even funny bad. Devoid of context and stakes, poorly
                        set up and completely shallow and unrelatable characters. These aren't even high standards in
                        children's cartoons, there are other Pokemon movies and shows with far higher quality. Anyway,

                        Super weird movie where the main character is a very normal man in a very weird and scary world,
                        and his response is chronic terror. A great watch with friends especially when one randomly pops
                        in to check it out mid stream and gets very confused.

                        the end where some semblance of justice is served. Then the film goes "Oh by the way, all of
                        that happened for real" and you can't help but feel it all over again. Worth every minute.

                        This is a fictional film, but is it really? I've met guys like this, I'm sure they were even
                        worse back in those days. Sure, the events of this particular movie aren't real, but events and
                        people like them have. Sometimes we forget that California became so rich because of all the war
                        criminals, war profiteers, and war mongers. This "defense" engineer, which is a misnomer in and
                        of itself, this war engineer is just one of many. Plenty more don't lose their jobs and go on a
                        rampage, instead being praised and well compensated for the hell they unleash.

                        Second film much like <a href="films.html#dune_part_one_film_review">the first</a>. Incredible
                        through and through. I'm really glad I read the book first because the plot itself is very
                        trimmed, and I'm not sure how much sense everything makes if you haven't read the book first. I
                        really hope there is an extended cut like the Lord of the Rings.

                        It was okay. Nothing stood out as particularly compelling, the main characters journey was not
                        very interesting, and the outcome was boring. The dream-like oddness of the setting made it hard
                        for me to latch on, it felt as arbitrary as old folk tales. It's like I'm missing a significant
                        cultural context that I would only have if I was a medieval peasant.

                        execution is perfect.

                        When this movie first came out I completely skipped it because I never watch trailers and I
                        misunderstood it to be more of a documentary about Hollywood. I don't know what gave me that
                        impression given the director. Eventually I did watch it and I'm really glad I did. The tension
                        in the commune, the crime, the balance of the two leads, the dog. Great movie as usual by
                        Tarantino.

                        Capitalism is not the solution to oppression, it is the root cause. Women becoming the oppressor
                        solves nothing and isn't what feminists at large want. But the film clearly would rather present
                        a "Conservative Capitalist" antagonist who is defeated at then end of the film not through
                        revolution but through willingly transforming into "Progressive Capitalism". The film claims
                        that nothing really needs to change in the world, we just need some female representation in the
                        oppressive class. But no. Capitalism can cover itself in Kente cloth, wear high heels, hold a
                        rainbow flag, but it is still the cause of the world suffering. Don't be fooled by false
                        promises.

                        This may be the archetypical heist movie. Maybe there is an earlier film that did it first or
                        maybe even better, but as far as I know when one talks about a heist, one usually means to pull
                        an Oceans 11. One thing that stands out though is Don Cheadle's accent. What were they thinking
                        with that?

                        <strong>2001 - A Space Odyssey</strong><br /><br />
                        I hated this movie. I read <a href="books.html#2001_a_space_odyssey_book_review">the book</a>
                        right before watching it so I had a whole mental picture of what it should look like which was
                        also informed by the aesthetics of modern science fiction films. I didn't expect it to look like
                        Dune, but I at least wanted to see something like Alien. Instead I got something far worse than
                        the David Lynch Dune and that is horrendous. Bad pacing, bad visuals, boring acting, didn't like
                        HAL. Maybe I'm just a hater (entirely possible) or maybe the book set too high of a bar
                        (unlikely, the book wasn't mind blowing either) but I just hate this movie.

                        An absolute must watch for all "Americans". Spike Lee does a really good job of expressing the
                        full breath of Brother Malcolm's life and beliefs, though it downplays his Islam which was
                        central to everything in his life. All people in "America" or who want to understand America
                        must study and understand Brother Malcolm and this is a great introduction, but there is so much
                        more to him. Read his speeches in chronological order to understand his ideological trajectory,
                        read books about him, learn what he tried to teach and carry his torch forward.

                        I did not expect a D&D movie to be made and certainly did not expect it to be this good. When I
                        saw it was first announced I expect it to be filled with 4th wall breaks and tabletop references
                        like dice rolls and such but no. They took it seriously and made a really good action comedy. It
                        was really nice to see all these fantastical creatures brought to life in such a beautiful way.

                        Turns out the story was kind of true, but partially fictionalized and embellished perspective.
                        DiCaprio and Hanks are just as good as you would expect.

                        make money never mind the ethics. What you might get is Nightcrawler. To be clear, he is still a
                        bad creepy weirdo for doing what he does in the film but it sure it a great car crash to watch
                        happen. Something about Jake makes me think it's not all acting.

                        Except it was one of those dine in theaters so everything stunk of burgers and fried onions for
                        the whole runtime of the movie.

                        Back when the film was first announced I immediately knew I had to read the book first. So I
                        made sure not to watch any trailers (as usual) and read the book and loved it. Then I watched
                        the film on release. There are whole massive chunks of the book entirely missing, but what is
                        shown is incredible. I was wholly engrossed for the entirety of the film. The sound, the music,
                        the visuals, the whole experience was exceptional. One nitpick is that the arabic pronunciations
                        are abysmal, were there no available language coaches? Anyway, I eagerly await the <a

                        <strong>Sonic The Hedgehog</strong><br /><br />
                        Sonic the Hedgehog is the first good movie based on a video game. There were cartoons and
                        comics, which likely were a major factor in the movie's success. I watched in on opening night
                        with friends and we had a great time.

                        <strong>Castaway on the Moon</strong><br /><br />
                        This was one of the first, if not the first, Korean film I ever watched and I instantly knew I
                        needed more. It's funny, it's sweet, and it shows the struggles of the people left behind by
                        South Korea's extremely capitalist society, what more can you ask for? I'll tell you what more
                        you can ask for:<br /><br /> Black bean noodles.

                        Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Joker certainly had an impact on western online discourse and
                        shallow ideology of internet racists but I can't say that is was an amazing film in my book.
                        Anxty, angry, antisocial.

                        <strong>Ponyo</strong><br /><br />
                        Ponyo was the first ever Ghibli film I watched and it has stayed close to my heart ever since.
                        The theme song is etched into my brain, I whistle it without realizing I am. The little steam
                        boat toy got me interested in the physics of how it worked, and the Morse flash light Sosuke has
                        is one of my most wanted trinkets.
