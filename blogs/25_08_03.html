            </div>
            <p>
                Last year I decided to finally take the plunge and make a personal website. It wasn't my first attempt
                but it was my first real attempt. I had made a few websites before but they were empty, directionless,
                and devoid of soul. This time I wanted to do it right so I watched some tutorials, read some articles,
                browsed Neocities and then got to writing HTML and CSS.<br><br>
                One year later, here we are. Hundreds of nature photos, dozens of books, shows, films, and games
                reviewed. Many blog and micro-blogs written. A myriad of projects, artworks, game dev projects
                documented. And a growing page of links you should check out after you're done reading.<br><br>
                Looking back at the first year of Craft Beetle I feel proud of what I made and more importantly proud of
                how regularly I updated it and continue to do so. So often I start something great and never finish it,
                or do one and drop the series. This website is a testament to consistency above all else, consistent
                updates, consistent theme, consistent ideals.<br><br>
                I created Craft Beetle as a rebellion against the commercial web, advertizement, capitalism,
                imperialism, consumerism, and the associated ills. I wanted this site to be a home for my thoughts and
                creations, not all of them, but those meant to be shared with the world. I know some of my friends
                regularly visit my site and that means the world to me. I intentionally did not add any tracking or
                visiting stats to Craft Beetle, both because I deeply care about privacy, but also because I knew that
                if I had a number telling me how many people visited my site I would become obsessed. So instead I ask
                you, the reader, to send me an email. I think it would be really cool and deeply human, don't be shy,
                I'm a regular human on the other end of the screen too.<br><br>
                Looking forward, I'm hoping for more consistency as well as some new pages, tweaks, and upgrades moving
                forward. I think I built a really solid foundation and I now feel comfortable trying to get more
                creative. I hope to see you soon for another update.
