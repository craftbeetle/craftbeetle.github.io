                <span class="date">25.06.06</span>
                <a class="back-to-blogs" href="/blog.html" target="_self">BACK TO BLOGS</a>

            <p>
                There will be no American revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of the American revolutionary is to identify revolutions in the Third World and support them in
                their struggle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The American revolutionary must do everything in their ability to enforce a divestment from counter
                revolutionary forces, to stand in the way of interventionism, to decriminalize the resistance, to
                un-manufacture consent, to boycott the products of oppression, to materially support the global
                struggle, to put the people of the world before themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                America is 4% of the world population. Yet its people see themselves as the protagonists of history.
                Never does it occur to the American that they should throw themselves into the gears of the machine in
                order to save the other 96% of the world population. Americans union workers will strike for better
                wages but carve out exceptions for weapons shipments. Americans will claim to seek the development of
                the rest of the world until that rest of the world disagrees with them, then it's just oil and cobalt
                and rubber.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact of the matter is the rest of the world is rising, and there is nothing America can do to stop
                it. The American revolutionary must wake up from the American Dream and join the rest of the world in
                the imperial reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are a colonist, no different from a Zionist, an Afrikaner, a Boer, a Canadian, a Kiwi, an
                Australian, a French Algerian. If the revolution is what you truly seek then you should recognize your
                position and use it to advance the global revolution. You are not owed a house with a green yard and a
                white picket fence on stolen land. You are not owed safety and security while your government bombs the
                world. You are not owed good working conditions while aiding and abetting genocide. You are not owed a
                fair wage while exploiting Third World labor. The sooner you realize that the sooner you can get on with
                the real work of revolution. The longer you remain asleep, yearning for the American Dream, the longer
                you will find your aims thwarted by global capitalism.
            </p>
