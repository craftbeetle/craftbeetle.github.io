            <h2 id="blog_24_12_15">Inner Monologue</h2>
            <div class="blog-header">
                <span class="date">24.12.15</span>
                <a class="back-to-blogs" href="/blog.html" target="_self">BACK TO BLOGS</a>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                Some people have internal monologues and some people do not. It's also likely that people can
                transition between the two, and use the two modes depending on the task. Could this be analogous to
                the generative AI's pure vector math and its abstraction through the transformer?<br /><br />

                I use both the internal monologue as well as the wordless mode of thinking. Some of my thoughts are
                rhetorical and so it is as if I am having a conversation with myself. An internal dialectic that
                produces synthesized ideas. Other thoughts are physical, like 3D objects and physics calculations,
                and those I process wordlessly, often accompanied with either mental images or just mathematical
                intuition, like mental vectors.<br /><br />

                One interesting consequence of this is that for technical projects most of the work I do is entirely
                in my head. I design, manufacture, test, and iterate completely in my imagination. If asked to
                describe my thoughts to a fellow engineer, I give exact step by step instructions that will
                perfectly reproduce what I am thinking, and I am usually correct in my designs. Going back to the AI
                analogy, it is as if I load a pruned physics model into my mind's RAM, add in LORAs and embeddings
                for whatever material or special condition I am working with, and do all my work in this virtual
                environment. Then, when I sit at a computer with SolidWorks or an IDE I simply export my thoughts
                into reality. I am so familiar with SolidWorks and Python that by the time I actually sit down to
                export, my fingers do all the work and my mind is off.<br /><br />

                I don't think this is unique for me. My guess is that most people trained in certain tasks do this.
                Musicians can compose music in their minds, architects imagine buildings, writers create characters
                away from the page, mathematicians wrestle numbers away from the chalkboard. I asked a fellow
                engineer if this was the case for them as well and they replied in the affirmative, perfectly
                describing my own process.<br /><br />

                This isn't to say that there is never a need to work things out outside of the mind. This mostly
                works for things we are really good at, as for the rest, and usually more complicated things with
                unknown variables, a more systematic and deliberate approach is needed.<br /><br />

                There seems to be a need for both types of thinking. The question usually asked is:<br /><br />

                How do people with/without an inner monologue think?<br /><br />

                I think the more interesting question is:<br /><br />

                Why doesn't everyone use both modes of thinking?
