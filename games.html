                Here live some of my thoughts on the games I have completed or played enough of. Sometimes I have a
                lot to say about the games I spend hours playing. Sometimes I play a game for a few hours, think
                it's neat, and put it down forever.

                        A cute little game about shooting goblins in purgatory while hunting down a witch. It's got a
                        cute art style and fun enough game play but it is a little too simple for repeated loops as a
                        roguelike and it has a memory leak that causes it to turn into a slideshow by mid dungeon. To be
                        fair this is all to be expected from an Early Access game, I do not fault it. I guess I'll just
                        have to pick it up again when it fully releases and see if it has improved.

                        Maybe I'm not as young and dexterous as I use to be. It's a repeating theme in these reviews. As
                        I have reflected on the games I use to play and those I play now I have noticed a maturation.
                        What I have lost in quick reflexes in and abundant free time, I have gained in appreciation of
                        narrative and emotional depth.<br /><br /> Maybe it's all cope because I tried replaying some
                        Super Meat Boy and couldn't get past the first boss which I had beat easily when I was
                        younger.<br /><br /> Who's to know?

                        All I knew about this game was a single screenshot of Mae and Gregg on a bike and the vague idea
                        of communism. What I found was a character driven story about the collapse of formerly
                        industrial middle America and the very real personal struggles of people navigating that
                        collapse. I enjoyed talking to each character every day, I enjoyed exploring Possum Springs and
                        taking in the views, I enjoyed finding all the little hidden spaces that humanize a place. The
                        choice to use anthropomorphic animals for the characters counterintuitively humanizes the
                        characters because we cannot see their phenotype, we have to instead pay attention to their
                        thoughts, feelings, actions. The ending, which I won't spoil, was as satisfying as the rest of
                        the story. The guitar mini-game was fun and the music in the game was motivated and
                        beautiful.<br /><br /> Gregg rulz ok.

                        simple visuals that fit perfectly. It was a joy to play Ape Out. The game is clearly made with a

                    <p> <strong>Metal Gear Rising: Revengence</strong><br /><br />
                        I admit that before playing Metal Gear Rising: Revengence, I was not a fan of Kojima's. Maybe
                        even a hater. Not in the true sense, I really loved the lore and world he made, but I could only
                        ever enjoy it through lore videos and never could get into the games. I think that was partially
                        because the first game of his I tried to play was MGS V which has a 2 hour intro that is mostly
                        cutscenes and by the time I finished it I was already burned out and put the game down. Not to
                        mention that when I first tried MGR I played it on Difficult, died once, and gave up. All that
                        to say I came in with the wrong attitude and expectations. Years passed and I decided to give
                        MGR another chance, if only to see Senator Armstrong. I was patient with the controls, respected
                        the difficulty, sat back and enjoyed the cut scenes and low and behold it all clicked. <br><br>
                        I love this game, it's silly, it's 2010s awesome, the music bangs, the action is over the top,
                        the ideology isn't bad, and the pacing is perfect. When I played engaged with the game how it
                        wanted to be engaged with I realized that the point of the cut scenes was to give you a bit of
                        relief from the action. With this new perspective I am considering playing the other games in
                        the series in release order to actually appreciate the overarching story being told. It really
                        did help that I played it on my Steam Deck instead of my PC, being able to lay comfortably in
                        bed makes the long cutscenes far more palatable.<br><br> PS: I love Jetstream Sam and Senator
                        Armstrong. Blade Wolf is the goodest boy.

                        I got OlliOlli World because I enjoyed my time with <a
                            href="games.html#olliolli2_game_review">OlliOlli2 - Welcome to Olliwood</a>. World has a
                        good character customization system and an actual plot and characters, but neither of those
                        things is the point of the game and they have no real effect on it. I was disappointed with the
                        actual gameplay. It's relatively shallow, repetitive, and mostly grinds. There is little
                        feedback on actions taken and basically no need to do complex moves, other than the score.
                        Famous 3D skating games succeed when they provide many challenges of different types: Speed,
                        style, combo length, jumps, specific moves in order, etc... <br><br> I completed one of four

                        I am a huge fan of 5th generation graphics. I didn't play video games back then so I don't have
                        nostalgia for the style, I just think it looks really nice. In the same way that photographs
                        didn't make the painting obsolete, realistic 3D graphics do not make crunchy low poly graphics
                        obsolete. That being said I don't love everything about that era of games: the low FPS, the
                        pop-in, and specifically the PS1's warble.<br /><br /> Retro 3D game preamble completed, Need
                        for Speed III: Hot Pursuit is really fun! Looks amazing, sounds real good, hard to drive but
                        once it clicks it clicks. At first I was bumping off the walls and crashing horribly in the
                        hazards, but after some practice I was sticking to the line and drifting just the right amount.
                        Highly enjoyable!

                    <p> <strong>Bad North</strong><br /><br />
                        It seems a little too simple at first. Just move your guys to kill their guys. The more of your
                        guys the better. But as you go on from island to island the complexity and the fun begins to
                        layer on. You start realizing that the skills, items, money, power ups, all have a place and a
                        use. You start to realize there there are more optimal ways to fight. <br /><br /> By the time I
                        felt I really got the hang of Bad North, I was quick switching units, shields first to absorb
                        projectiles and charges then spears to do damage, I was putting spear-men at the top of stairs
                        and slopes and at the mouth of choke-points to get an advantage, I was taking pot shots and
                        retreating with my archers. The game is so active and dynamic, the stakes are high enough that
                        you don't want to lose and low enough that you are confident experimenting and discovering new
                        tactics.<br /><br /> I really enjoyed playing Bad North and will definitely be coming back to it
                        once in a while.

                        A great idea but a very difficult execution. Driving as hard enough from a fixed perspective,
                        drifting is ever harder. I was able to execute some pretty clean moves but it was inconsistent
                        and not very satisfying. Maybe with more practice I could have gotten it but I just didn't feel
                        compelled to go on.

                        and the combat is fun. But, as is becoming a theme of my game reviews, I simply do not have the
                        time to play games for as long as they want to be played. I would have loved to experience the
                        story of Hades, but being a rogue like infinitely replayable game with incrementally drip-fed
                        story, I could barely scratch the surface before I stopped playing.

                        Let me start off by saying that I did in fact play this game for more than 20 minutes, but I did
                        not beat it. It's a Vampire Survivor like with pretty good gameplay but not anything I expect to
                        be replaying any time soon. It's good at what it set out to do but seeing as I have not played
                        Vampire Survivor, I've got no idea if it's as good at what seems like the gold standard.

                        trying to get all my actions to line up to the rhythm and I struggled. Then I gave up on that
                        and just played it as a regular FPS, shooting and jumping and dashing whenever I want and I did
                        much better. I had a fun time with it, but with it's main gimmick so weak I'm not hooked.

                        Impressive how much a three man team can achieve when concerned only with good gameplay and not
                        worrying about the best graphics or the most aggressive monetization or advertising. It's
                        especially poignant as BattleBit Remastered released around the same time the newest Battlefield
                        game flopped. This, and the success of many other indie games, as well as the slew of recent AAA
                        flops and layoffs is a clear sign of the readjustment of the industry. Interest free money is
                        gone, the period of massive growth is over, labor is up, and the video game corporations are
                        being out competed by solo devs and indie studios.<br /><br /> That all being said, and as much
                        fun as I had with this game, at time of writing it seems to have been abandoned by the
                        developers which is actually a bit of a rare case when it comes to success indie games. AAA
                        corporation on the other hand are more than happy to shutter whole studios making widely popular
                        games simply because profits weren't high enough.

                        for the difficulty mainly due to the clunky interface and slow time to get back in the fight. I
                        have played hours of this game and enjoyed them but I have to put it down.

                        FromSoft nails it again with an amazing game. It was difficult from start to finish and all the
                        better for it. Every time I struggled against a boss and finally figured them out and beat them
                        felt amazing, and returning to old areas only to find that I was easily beating old foes with
                        little effort was very rewarding. I must admit that I stopped playing the game right at the
                        final boss. Maybe someday I will come back to it and truly complete it. I think my mistake was
                        taking too long of a break after getting stuck and losing my muscle memory. Regardless of not
                        completing the game, I still enjoyed every moment, even the repeated deaths. I vividly remember
                        every zone and boss, which is a testament to the quality of the craftsmanship.

                        the same. I first learned about this game from House of Cards. That did not age well, but the
                        game was good enough to survive that hit.

                        I played this game in short bursts on my phone over the course of a week. I think that is really
                        what it was designed for, I can't image sitting down at a computer and focusing on it. The
                        mechanics have enough depth to be engrossing until the end of the game. I slew the spire and
                        unlocked all 4 characters, though The Silent was my favorite and was the one I used to beat the
                        game. Overall a very enjoyable experience.

                        I had a passing interest in the game and finally decided to pick it up after Jacob Geller made a
                        video about it. It has such an amazing progression, from the episodic aging to the true ending.
                        I started out as I assume most do, running around getting hit, dying, barely making it through
                        levels. But as I got better at the game I slowly mastered the flow of bait and punish, as well
                        as the rush and strike. I easily made it through large portions of the game untouched and
                        finally finished the game first in the bad ending and then the good. The bonus stages were also
                        a blast. In a strange turn of events, this game caused me to want to play Sekiro. I needed more
                        of that beautiful parrying gameplay. <br /> Side note: I played on Linux and experienced a GPU
                        memory leak. The game would get progressively slower until it became a slide show and I had to
                        reboot it. I finally found the cause in one of the graphics settings and it was fixed.

                        I have to admit I was a huge hater when this game came out. I had absolutely no hype for it,
                        didn't watch any trailers and new very little about it. So to me, all I saw was a game
                        struggling and floundering, and developer promises broken and a poor product sold at full price.
                        I wrote the game off and moved on. Fast forward to the 2.1 patch. On a whim I broke my promise
                        of never playing this game and bought it and the DLC on sale. Little did I know the game would
                        become one of my favorites of all time. I think it really helped that I didn't have any
                        expectation for the game, I know a lot of people expected an RPG with dialogue and decisions and
                        character progression, and of course were disappointed with a mostly linear game. Meanwhile I
                        came in expecting to shoot a bunch of goons for about 10 hours and was happily surprised with
                        100 hrs of beautiful realistic and well acted characters, a compelling story, and very fun
                        gameplay. Johnny Silverhand lives rent free in my head.

                        I bought and played Lethal Company at a good friend's insistence and enjoyed it when we played
                        together. The whole enjoyment of the experience came down to us yelling at each other, screaming
                        in fear, and having a goofy time. The game itself served as a good enough medium which is all I
                        think it was ever meant to be.

                        The aesthetic and presentation are on point but the gameplay is lacking. It may just be that I
                        am not into boomer shooters but I often find myself either lost or bored of the repetitive
                        gameplay. It may be accurate for a boomer shooter to have generic enemy AI and a simplistic
                        world design but it doesn't excuse the lack of fun. If it weren't for the presentation and
                        general polish, I would say this is a mediocre game getting propped up by the 40K IP.

                        look, mannerisms, quirks, and everything that makes cat what they are. It was so intuitive
                        because I would just think "what would a cat do" and inevitable the game would reward that

                        alternate ending achievements, I beat completely. I started playing it the night it released and
                        by the end of 100+ hours of playing I had beat every single boss solo and completed the game. I
                        really enjoyed my time with it, as is apparent from how long I spent playing. Obviously this
                        took months as I do not have as much free time as others. For the record I played as a samurai
                        and I used the starting gear through the whole game.

                        largest as can be seen in my critters page. But it always feels wrong to observe an animal in
                        captivity, clearly they are not meant to be where we have put them, and so they will never
                        behave how they truly would in their natural environment. ABZÛ attempted, and I would argue
                        succeeded, in letting you unobtrusively observe aquatic environments up close and personal. It
                        will never be at good as deep sea diving, but I don't intend on ever doing that so this is more
                        than good enough. Highly recommend to all.

                        netcode and melee hit registration. I would not recommend it now, but it was fun with friends

                        Steam library and decided to give it another shot. That was the beginning of what became an over
                        %100 completion run and some speed runs. I really love this game, it just sounds and looks and
                        plays so right. You may have noticed that I liked the game so much that I themed the whole

                        Corporate work sure is a slog. Aggro Crab's going under is a cute delve into an assortment of
                        modern corporate jobs and their pitfalls as formulated under capitalism. The goal of each
                        "dungeon" is to be the boss (my favorite of which is the Caffiend). The weapon mechanic keep the
                        game feeling fresh and the writing is very human. The game is limited in it's economic analysis
                        by not pushing for unionization, which would actually help protect the Joblins and other
                        workers. Instead the game essentially stops at criticizing startups, the gig economy, modern
                        dating, and crypto. All valid criticisms but somewhat hollow without the underlying cause of
                        capitalism being analyzed. Regardless I loved the game, completed it and played a bit of the
                        infinite dungeon before happily retiring it.

                        Ghost of Tsushima is easily one of the best games I have ever played. I first played it on
                        normal but after about an hour I turned the difficulty to max and it clicked. The whole point of
                        samurai and ninja is the long periods of calm punctuated by explosions of highly lethal
                        violence. Turning the difficulty up made it so that if I didn't make every strike and basically
                        not get hit I would die, which compliments this game's aesthetic and theme as well as its
                        mechanics.<br /><br /> Both stealth and action are viable so I hunted in hiding until I was
                        discovered when I went loud. I was so immersed that I would clean my sword, bow, and play a song
                        after every fight because it just felt right to pay respect, especially after beating important
                        characters. There was nothing forcing me to do that, nor was there any reward, but it was what
                        Jin would have done.

                        <summary>Spoilers</summary><br /> I loved my horse. I named him Kage and for the first 2/3 of
                        the game he was with me and we fought the invasion. He came when I called and was there when I
                        needed him most. Then he died. And I was heart broken. But I was in a bad place and I needed
                        another horse so I got on a skinny burned horse and ran off north. When I got there I rested and
                        my allies offered my a choice of fresh horses. But it felt wrong. I stood there, didn't pick a
                        horse, looked around for my old ragged one and to my surprise the game allowed me to keep my
                        tired old horse. <br /><br /> Moments like these made the game feel so right. Another moment
                        like this was the final fight against my uncle. I really didn't want to kill him. I didn't want
                        to fight him at all. But he insisted, and when I beat him he asked to die in honor and I
                        fulfilled his wish. I felt that letting him live would be a punishment to him and I wanted him
                        to instead have peace.

                    Playing as Jin Sakai, exploring the beautiful island of Tsushima, fighting against the mongols and
                    traitor samurai, living in that world, it was all such a great experience.

                        was really into Apex back when it first came out. The match making was great, characters were
                        fresh, and the gameplay was really fun. I admit I didn't win very many times but I did have a
                        great time. It became less fun as people got really good at the game and were still matched with
                        me. I don't have much time to practice so I don't get all that good, and I'm old. Cope. Either
                        way I dropped off the game. I'm glad I played it when I did.

                        I played Genshin Impact instead of studying for a math exam. I was pretty hooked for about a
                        week, right around launch. Traversal was good enough and for a mobile game it was fairly
                        impressive. It was still a shallow gacha game and I soon lost interest when the grind set in.

                        I've played Dead Cells on and off since release. I got one boss cell once and ever since then I
                        haven't been able to beat it and get more. Still trying but for the most part I just enjoy the
                        flow state of running fast and getting as many kills as possible without getting hit. There's
                        something really sweet about seeing the skull number go up. Maybe I would do better if I read
                        the item and ability descriptions but no, that's for nerds, and I am an entirely different kind
                        of nerd.

                        Hands down one of my favorite games of all time. My first playthrough was absolutely blind and I
                        found the game completely enchanting. The voices, the painterly aesthetic, the characters and
                        choices that affect them. I loved every bit. Then I played it again and found even more to love.
                        This game and it's amazing writing has concretely changed me as a person.

                        This game is likely the best detective game ever made. I'll never be able to play it for the
                        first time again which is the greatest tragedy. Using only two colors, no animations, and
                        relying almost entirely on sound and a moment's freeze frame, the game sets up sub-mystery after
                        sub-mystery all building towards the overall mystery and plot. Easily one of the best games of
                        all time.

                        Metal Slug is one of the few games I remember playing on an arcade machine and on a PS2 at a
                        cousin's house ages ago. I was drawn to it by the stylized animations and very emotive designs.
                        Even the tank felt organic. I eventually got MS3 on steam and played it though one afternoon and
                        while it could never recapture the feeling of feeding a machine quarters after a day at the
                        pool, it did scratch the itch for great design.

                        OlliOlli2 is a simple 2D skating game that is pretty effective. While it cannot complete with 3D
                        skating games, it does fill it's niche well. The left stick motions needed to do different
                        tricks is effective and fun.

                        mid 2010s so of course it was a zombie game and a really fun one being as simple as it was. I
                        ended up completing it, and enjoyed it enough to pick up again once or twice more since.

                        Definitely the best Borderlands game in the series. The first game was very rough and I didn't
                        play it much at all. The others in the series went overboard and by then I was too old for that
                        type of humor. Borderlands 2 hit just the right kind of tone at the right time in my life so it
                        just clicked. My first ever cosplay was that on a borderland psycho. The best part of the outfit
                        was my hand made <a href="crafts.html#crafts_borderlands_psycho_mask">mask</a>, which survives
                        to this day.

                        First thing that hits you when start Flatout is <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqKKSTR6EEg" target="_blank">"Beat the Boys"</a> by
                        LAB over a montage of beautiful cars racing, crashing, and wiping out. I first played Flatout in
                        middle school computer class. We would quickly finish our classwork and boot up either Flatout,
                        TrackMania, or Robot Arena. Of course our favorite mode of Flatout was the demolition derby, in
                        fact, I don't think we ever did a single race. Having replayed it again recently I was
                        immediately transported to that computer class. We never did learn anything about computers
                        though.

                        I have been playing Dwarf Fortress on and off since around 2010. Back then I neither understood
                        nor could run the game effectively, but I was still enamored by the possibility and the stories
                        people created in the game. I followed development and bought the game as soon as it released on
                        Steam because I felt the need to give back to the game devs who had created such a wonderful
                        game and shared it with the world for free for nearly as long as I have been alive. Now with
                        native graphics, mouse controls and all the rest it is one of the greatest games of all time.

                        Age of Empires II has a special place in my heart. I haven't played it in a long time and I was
                        never particularly good at it but it is one of the oldest games I remember playing, alongside
                        minesweeper and pinball. I absolutely love the art, the way the units move, the carefully
                        designed buildings. The sound effects are ingrained into my brain. The villager spawning breath,
                        the enemy contact bells, the quips, the wololo. I'm no good at RTS games, I don't have the will
                        to get good, but AoE2 will always be one of my favorite games of all time.

                        didn't like being the victim of horror games. When instead playing as a formless mass of
                        vitriolic meat, I am much more at ease. Who amongst us isn't a formless mass of vitriolic meat
                        once in a while? Anyway, I enjoyed a quiet summer day morning playing Carrion and left feeling
                        it had lasted exactly as long as it should have.

                        I must admit first and foremost that I am not a space fan. I know many people who are fascinated
                        by the big empty void of mostly nothing and follow rocket and satellite news very closely and
                        have Lego shuttles as decor. I am not one of them. I respect space, I think it's neat, good
                        stuff has come out of space but I have always been a land loving person.<br /><br /> That all
                        being said, I had a good time with Kerbal Space Program. The rocket building mechanics are easy
                        to understand and hard to master, the orbital mechanics are accurate and fun to set up and
                        execute, overall it was good.<br /><br /> I did stop playing as soon as I could get rockets in
                        orbit and docking consistently, and landing on the moon. Once I was able to do that there just
                        want anything else left to do that interested me.

                        I never play horror games but this one is something different. Maybe it's more horror themed
                        action? Whatever the category, it is one of my favorite games, especially having played it the
                        first time on the hardest difficulty. I got into a flow where I knew exactly how many bullets
                        each one of my guns had and how much time I had on my air filters. No UI, extreme difficulty,
                        amazing game.

                    <p> <strong>The Ascent</strong><br /><br />
                        The world of the ascent is beautifully detailed visually and uses depth and far off backgrounds
                        to imply a much larger space than is actually playable. But while the visuals are nice and the
                        combat and gameplay overall are good, the game is disappointing. One of the core aspects of the
                        cyberpunk genre is the exploration of humanity. The robots and explosions and tech are cool and
                        great, but without the fundamental interrogation of real human existence it all rings hollow. It
                        seems odd to say this about a twin-stick shooter, and I agree, not all games have to be deep
                        introspection. The issue is that the gun-play isn't all that deep so a void is left that should
                        have been filled with a moving story.<br /><br /> I enjoyed my time with the game and got pretty
                        far into it before putting it down.
