            <p>
                Here are the TV shows that I have watched. Some of these had my full attention for the duration,
                while others played on a second or third monitor and were mostly listened to and glanced at for
                context. Either way I finished them which means I enjoyed them to some extent. Note: Shows are in
                the year categories of the last watched season.

                <p>
                    <strong>Mr. Robot</strong><br /><br />
                    I was drawn to Mr. Robot because the hacking was so good, the anti-capitalist message was clear, and
                    the quality was on point. I originally watched the first season as it air and was hooked, but then a
                    fell off before the second season. I have now watched it all, start to finish, and it was great. The
                    hacking is realistic. Often times the hardest part is getting physical access to the machine, then
                    the hack itself is ransomware or sabotage. The acting and psychological aspect of the show really
                    gives it that extra kick, though I felt it became a bit too central in the later seasons. One of the
                    risks of making a show with a lot of secrets is that your audience may not know enough to root for
                    the protagonist and that happened to me in the third and fourth seasons.
                <details>
                    <summary>Spoilers</summary><br />
                    Taking down Evil Corp is nice and simple, but opposing White Rose for no clearly explained reason?
                    Especially when White Rose makes a compelling argument against the current state of the world and
                    has a machine they claim can fix it? That did not click for me.
                </details><br />
                Still the show is worth watching despite that, the characters and their internal conflicts carry the
                show.

                    <strong>A Good Girl's Guide To Murder</strong><br /><br />
                    A Good Girl's Guide to Murder was a great mini series that showed Myers was just as good as a
                    lead actress. It was nice to see a story set in a more rural side of the UK and to have such a
                    diverse cast used so well. As usual, I won't spoil the plot, but I can confirm it is a good
                    story well realized.

                    After the sour taste of the last few seasons of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon has brought
                    back a cautious love for the show. As always the acting, story, and production are unmatched.
                    The winding ever complicating political machinations and occasional bursts of violence keep me
                    glued to the screen.

                    What a beautiful show and what attention to detail. I couldn't tear my eyes off the screen as I
                    watched the 4K remake dub. The animations and cinematic angles repeatedly caught be my surprise.
                    This show was first aired in the late 70s so it's easy to see the layers of paper and the
                    animation techniques. And yet as is often the case with new art forms, the lack of other works
                    to copy creates an environment where the artists are forced to pull from the real world for
                    inspiration.

                    <strong>Station Eleven</strong><br /><br />
                    I remember damage. The story benefits greatly from the out-of-other telling and the comic book
                    anchor. I'm glad I randomly stumbled upon this series. I can't say much about it other than it's
                    somehow so real because of it's oddness.

                    It's so cute, and I have never wanted to learn to cook so much. The consistent upbeat energy,
                    the wonderfully sweet characters, the creative writing. Even death is just a bit of a nuisance.
                    My favorite is Chilchuck of course: clever and grumpy. I'm really looking forward to season 2!

                    At first I didn't understand it. Then I finished it and before I realized what I was doing I had
                    a rat's nest of cables and multiple terminals open to various devices. Something about Lain
                    makes me want to build a makeshift server around my bed and also flood my house. Weird.

                    <strong>Better Call Saul</strong><br /><br />
                    Probably the most notable thing about this show, other than being a miraculously good spin off
                    of an amazing show, is the emotional range displayed. Saul is at time funny and goofy and at
                    other times thrilling and miserable, and often they are layered. Saul responds to his misery
                    with mockery. Who knew lawyering could be so fun? I guess it's only so fun when you consider the
                    law a game, a puzzle, a nut to crack.

                    <strong>The Vince Staples Show</strong><br /><br />
                    You can imagine my mild surprise when I saw this show on Netflix. I assumed it was a documentary
                    style "here's how I live" kind of show, but what I found was more akin to Atlanta. Not as
                    serious or well written, but funny and charismatic enough to be worth a watch. My favorite part
                    is the bank robbery, the of that scene is to die for.

                    <strong>Generation Kill</strong><br /><br />
                    Well if you wanted to see a tiny slice of American war crimes and the reason why the world
                    (justifiably) hates the US, here it is. I watched this show amazed at how brazenly the soldiers
                    committed these crimes. Most interest are the rational soldiers, like Ice Man, who did not
                    intentionally kill civilians but nonetheless willingly participate in the invasion of a foreign
                    country and remained in a military that killed civilians so frequently and coldly. How one
                    justifies that to themselves, I'm not sure. Especially the medic, did they think that all
                    medicine is good? Do American military medics think that saving the lives of child killers is a
                    good thing? Maybe they honestly do. The most chilling part of the show if the end, when you
                    realize that it's not "based" on real events, it IS real events. There is an interview online
                    with the real soldiers in the show, and one of them even played himself in the show. Incredible.

                    I loved it and I don't care what anyone says. I nearly cried every 5 minutes of the first 3
                    episodes. I don't know why, maybe it was the resolution to the long held trauma of the movie,
                    maybe it was the void left behind by the show, or the sour taste of sequel. Either way I loved
                    this show and it's depiction of the characters and story.

                    I don't think I have ever seen a Samurai film/show that so clearly discusses the Dutch and what
                    they got up to. That may just be me though, I haven't seen everything related to the this time

                    <strong>Succession</strong><br /><br />
                    A viper pit. A very complex and interconnected viper pit. A pit of flawed and interdependent
                    vipers. What makes Succession work is that none of the characters can achieve their aims by
                    themselves and none can trust each other to help them. There are no allies and enemies, no
                    morality and ideology, only power. In this way it is very similar to statecraft, and one could
                    argue what states and modern companies are very similar. It's no wonder then that cyberpunk has
                    megacorps as governments in the hyper-capitalist near future.

                    If you ever wanted to understand police culture, at least in the north east in that the early
                    2000s, this is the show for you. The writer spent years with these same police departments as a
                    reporter, so when he writes his characters they come of as incredibly real. This is not an
                    overtly copaganda show (though one could argue that in the same way that all war films are
                    pro-war, all cop shows are pro-cop). Each season has a theme and explores different facets of
                    police, politics, gangs culture, and poverty. I recommended it to anyone who will listen.

                    <strong>Paper Girls</strong><br /><br />
                    I had no idea they had made this show until I stumbled upon it on Amazon Prime. I had read the
                    comic one summer many years back and absolutely loved it. Watching this show was so sweet, then
                    I looked for the second season and found out the show had been canceled. What an absolute
                    tragedy. I don't think I will ever recover. Anyway, I recommend <a
                        href="books.html#paper_girls_book_review">the comic</a>!

                    <strong>The Witcher</strong><br /><br />
                    The first season was confusing, the second season was kind of forgettable. Maybe this show is
                    more enjoyable if you have read all the books, or at the very least played Witcher 3. I came in
                    to the show having culturally osmosed much of the games but that was not enough I guess. Henry
                    Cavill was great of course, and the Toss a Coin to Your Witcher song is a banger, as for the
                    rest... eh.

                    <strong>The Diplomat</strong><br /><br />
                    An American diplomat in the UK. What a boring sounding concept, then I watched it and found that
                    I really like these kinds of "Important people in suits talk about stuff" shows and movies. I
                    later started following UK, EU, and world politics much more closely and find it even funnier
                    now that the UK prime minister is impotently awaiting American permission to blow something up,
                    anything.

                    A cute little show about death. Neato! It's kinda weird and kinda good and kinda cute and very
                    worth the watch. Be good to your siblings.

                    One of my favorite video games of all time is made into a TV show, and they nail it? I must be
                    dreaming. They killed the casting. The adaptation was on point. Fortunately the game was already
                    film like and the story was the main draw, but that did guarantee that it would be a good
                    adaptation? No. But they pulled it off anyway. This show earns its title.

                    <strong>Wednesday</strong><br /><br />
                    I didn't think I would like this show so much. I don't like horror theme, I didn't watch the
                    originals, and yet it was fun watch. The story isn't anything super deep, it's essentially a
                    high school drama. It's mainly Wednesday's cold, creepy personal, contrasted with her roommate
                    that really carried the show.

                    <strong>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</strong><br /><br />
                    I watched Edgerunners while I was still refusing to engage with the game so I didn't have the full
                    context but it is a prequel and I did know enough about the game and setting to fully understand it.
                    That being said, I did not like the show. I found the pacing, editing, and sound were really off and
                    just didn't work for me. I really enjoyed some of Studio Trigger's other works such as BNA: Brand
                    New Animal and Delicious in Dungeon. Something about the writing for this one just wasn't it. Having
                    now completely finished Cyberpunk and the DLC I still stand by my opinion that the show just isn't
                    very good.

                    <strong>Arcane</strong><br /><br />
                    I cried so much. I still cannot even think of, let alone watch, the Powder breakdown scene
                    without sobbing. A beautiful show with highly real characters that shove their whole arm in your
                    chest and squeeze your heart. And to think I randomly found out about this show from the JID
                    music video, and even then I didn't realize it was a show promo for weeks. Incredible!
                    <br /><br />
                    Arcane is back! I enjoyed season two, and like the first season I did cry but I won't tell you when
                    or why, that's up to you to find out for yourself. The show remains really great, the characters
                    continue to evolve, and I was surprised when they managed to set up yet another captivating
                    cliffhanger.

                    BNA was my first encounter with Studio Trigger and they did really good. Of course there is the
                    weird analogy of real race and fantasy race, that is usually a shallow comparison. That aside, this
                    was a fun show, not mind blowing but fun show.
