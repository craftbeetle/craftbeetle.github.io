                America's future is locked into self-destruction. Perhaps there was a time we could have averted this
                doom, self inflicted doom, but that time is gone. Maybe America's doom was set in stone by Reagan, or by
                the failure of the left in compromising with FDR, or in the transatlantic slave trade, or in the
                genocide that founded and continues to fuel this country. Wherever you place the moment, the fact
                remains that America is destined to crash and burn. At any of those pivotal moment America could have
                rewritten its future by accepting its past and present and correcting its many, many faults. That time
                is passed, the window of opportunity closed when the uni-polar world dissolved. Now the controller has
                been unplugged, nothing we do now will change anything. America will burn, if we are lucky it will be
                reborn through the flame, if not, it will experience a century of humiliation. The contradictions are
                too great and too fundamental for any kind of incremental change or drastic correction. The foundation
                we build on is bloody quicksand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most in America have not yet realized their position. Most still plan for a normal future. Many have
                begun to smell the smoke but they believe the fire can be put out. Just build more houses. Just
                clean that lake or this river. Just pass that rights bill. They miss the fundamental nature of the
                unequal exchange they have materially benefited from and which has kept them unaware of the true
                nature of their condition. Americans sit in air conditioned rooms as the planet cooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the fall of America, as with the fall of any great beast, a cascade will occur in the
                ecosystem. Carrion will strip it for parts, disease will run rampant, the insides will spill out. US
                bases around the world will gradually be abandoned as resources grow scarce and America's wrath
                turns inwards once more. Territory will be lost: Puerto Rico, Guantanamo Bay, Hawaii, Virgin
                Islands, Guam, Alaska, Israel. Oligarchs will carve up the remaining territories into fiefdoms.
                Warlords will tear across the land. These things are hard to imagine for the United States, they
                were hard to imagine for the Romans too.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the great empire gone, the power vacuum will be filled by powers for the worse and the better.
                The world will reconfigure. Likely the B.R.I.C.S. will become the new way of international trade.
                The allies of the old empire will realign or suffer the consequences. Europe will continue down its
                own, slower demise and perhaps readjust before the worst.
            </p>
            <p>
                The global south will rise. The majority of the planet's population will finally be given an
                opportunity to breath. It will be ugly and beautiful and they throw off their shackles and stand
                tall. The old empire will be so weak as to not even deserve revenge. The Africans, Asians, and Latin
                Americans will send food aid and doctors without borders to America.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally a new world will be born, better than before, but mostly just different. The centers of
                power will move, the culture will change, and America will be a memory like the USSR. We will visit
                the new African country in the American black belt and wonder what it would have been like to live
                in the old Georgia back when Africans were killed by police with impunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                America is ending. There is nothing you can do to stop that. So instead, you should work towards
                what will be born in its ashes.
            </p>
