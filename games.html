            <p>
                Here live some of my thoughts on the games I have completed or played enough of. Sometimes I have a
                lot to say about the games I spend hours playing. Sometimes I play a game for a few hours, think
                it's neat, and put it down forever.

                    <strong>Ape Out</strong><br /><br />
                    Phenomenal sound design paired with a single visceral gameplay mechanic accompanied by very simple
                    visuals that fit perfectly. It was a joy to play Ape Out. The game is clearly made with a lot of
                    love and care and immense creativity.

                <p>
                    <strong>Metal Gear Rising: Revengence</strong><br /><br />
                    I admit that before playing Metal Gear Rising: Revengence, I was not a fan of Kojima's. Maybe even a
                    hater. Not in the true sense, I really loved the lore and world he made, but I could only ever enjoy
                    it through lore videos and never could get into the games. I think that was partially because the
                    first game of his I tried to play was MGS V which has a 2 hour intro that is mostly cutscenes and
                    by the time I finished it I was already burned out and put the game down. Not to mention that when I
                    first tried MGR I played it on Difficult, died once, and gave up. All that to say I came in with the
                    wrong attitude and expectations. Years passed and I decided to give MGR another chance, if only to
                    see Senator Armstrong. I was patient with the controls, respected the difficulty, sat back and
                    enjoyed the cut scenes and low and behold it all clicked. <br><br>
                    I love this game, it's silly, it's 2010s awesome, the music bangs, the action is over the top, the
                    ideology isn't bad, and the pacing is perfect. When I played engaged with the game how it wanted to
                    be engaged with I realized that the point of the cut scenes was to give you a bit of relief from the
                    action. With this new perspective I am considering playing the other games in the series in release
                    order to actually appreciate the overarching story being told. It really did help that I played it
                    on my Steam Deck instead of my PC, being able to lay comfortably in bed makes the long cutscenes far
                    more palatable.<br><br>
                    PS: I love Jetstream Sam and Senator Armstrong. Blade Wolf is the goodest boy.

                <p>
                    <strong>OlliOlli World</strong><br /><br />
                    I got OlliOlli World because I enjoyed my time with <a
                        href="games.html#olliolli2_game_review">OlliOlli2 - Welcome to Olliwood</a>.
                    World has a good character customization system and an actual plot and characters, but neither of
                    those things is the point of the game and they have no real effect on it. I was disappointed with
                    the actual gameplay. It's relatively shallow, repetitive, and mostly grinds. There is little
                    feedback on actions taken and basically no need to do complex moves, other than the score. Famous 3D
                    skating games succeed when they provide many challenges of different types: Speed, style, combo
                    length, jumps, specific moves in order, etc... <br><br>
                    I completed one of four worlds and did not feel compelled to continue playing.

                <p>
                    <strong>Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit</strong><br /><br />
                    I am a huge fan of 5th generation graphics. I didn't play video games back then so I don't have
                    nostalgia for the style, I just think it looks really nice. In the same way that photographs didn't
                    make the painting obsolete, realistic 3D graphics do not make crunchy low poly graphics obsolete.
                    That being said I don't love everything about that era of games: the low FPS, the pop-in, and
                    specifically the PS1's warble.<br /><br />
                    Retro 3D game preamble completed, Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit is
                    really fun! Looks amazing, sounds real good, hard to drive but once it clicks it clicks. At first I
                    was bumping off the walls and crashing horribly in the hazards, but after some practice I was
                    sticking to the line and drifting just the right amount. Highly enjoyable!

                    <strong>VVVVVV</strong><br /><br />
                    A short and sweet puzzle platformer that puts all of its effort into delivering a tight experience
                    and it succeeds. Only a few hours long but no room is wasted. Similar to Celeste in a lot of ways.

                    <strong>Absolute Drift</strong><br /><br />
                    A great idea but a very difficult execution. Driving as hard enough from a fixed perspective,
                    drifting is ever harder. I was able to execute some pretty clean moves but it was inconsistent and
                    not very satisfying. Maybe with more practice I could have gotten it but I just didn't feel
                    compelled to go on.

                    I enjoyed my time playing Marvel Rivals, though I am not one for Hero Shooters or competitive games.
                    I simply don't have the time to get good at them. Great game though, best I've played of the genre.

                    <strong>20 Minutes Till Dawn</strong><br /><br />
                    Let me start off by saying that I did in fact play this game for more than 20 minutes, but I did not
                    beat it. It's a Vampire Survivor like with pretty good gameplay but not anything I expect to be
                    replaying any time soon. It's good at what it set out to do but seeing as I have not played Vampire
                    Survivor, I've got no idea if it's as good at what seems like the gold standard.

                <p>
                    <strong>BPM: Bullets Per Minute</strong><br /><br />
                    BPM is really odd in that I understood it to be a rhythm game like Hi-Fi Rush so I started out
                    trying to get all my actions to line up to the rhythm and I struggled. Then I gave up on that and
                    just played it as a regular FPS, shooting and jumping and dashing whenever I want and I did much
                    better. I had a fun time with it, but with it's main gimmick so weak I'm not hooked.

                    <strong>BattleBit Remastered</strong><br /><br />
                    Impressive how much a three man team can achieve when concerned only with good gameplay and not
                    worrying about the best graphics or the most aggressive monetization or advertising. It's especially
                    poignant as BattleBit Remastered released around the same time the newest Battlefield game flopped.
                    This, and the success of many other indie games, as well as the slew of recent AAA flops and layoffs
                    is a clear sign of the readjustment of the industry. Interest free money is gone, the period of
                    massive growth is over, labor is up, and the video game corporations are being out competed by solo
                    devs and indie studios.<br /><br />
                    That all being said, and as much fun as I had with this game, at time of writing it seems to have
                    been abandoned by the developers which is actually a bit of a rare case when it comes to success
                    indie games. AAA corporation on the other hand are more than happy to shutter whole studios making
                    widely popular games simply because profits weren't high enough.

                    popular so I don't have any nostalgia for this. Unfortunately, it did not click for me.

                    A foundational game with absolutely beautiful artwork and animations. I would watch an
                    un-narrated long-play of this game just to follow the story. Though I do not have much patience
                    for the difficulty mainly due to the clunky interface and slow time to get back in the fight. I
                    have played hours of this game and enjoyed them but I have to put it down.

                    A cute little game kill a few hours. None of the puzzles were stumpers but the vibes were clean
                    and it didn't overstay its welcome. I also played the bonus levels and found them to be about
                    the same. I first learned about this game from House of Cards. That did not age well, but the
                    game was good enough to survive that hit.

                    it's only meant to be a little mini game but it didn't have the draw found in Flappy Bird or
                    2048.

                    I played this game in short bursts on my phone over the course of a week. I think that is really
                    what it was designed for, I can't image sitting down at a computer and focusing on it. The
                    mechanics have enough depth to be engrossing until the end of the game. I slew the spire and
                    unlocked all 4 characters, though The Silent was my favorite and was the one I used to beat the
                    game. Overall a very enjoyable experience.

                    I had a passing interest in the game and finally decided to pick it up after Jacob Geller made a
                    video about it. It has such an amazing progression, from the episodic aging to the true ending.
                    I started out as I assume most do, running around getting hit, dying, barely making it through
                    levels. But as I got better at the game I slowly mastered the flow of bait and punish, as well
                    as the rush and strike. I easily made it through large portions of the game untouched and
                    finally finished the game first in the bad ending and then the good. The bonus stages were also
                    a blast. In a strange turn of events, this game caused me to want to play Sekiro. I needed more
                    of that beautiful parrying gameplay. <br />
                    Side note: I played on Linux and experienced a GPU memory leak. The game would get progressively
                    slower until it became a slide show and I had to reboot it. I finally found the cause in one of
                    the graphics settings and it was fixed.

                    <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong><br /><br />
                    I have to admit I was a huge hater when this game came out. I had absolutely no hype for it,
                    didn't watch any trailers and new very little about it. So to me, all I saw was a game
                    struggling and floundering, and developer promises broken and a poor product sold at full price.
                    I wrote the game off and moved on. Fast forward to the 2.1 patch. On a whim I broke my promise
                    of never playing this game and bought it and the DLC on sale. Little did I know the game would
                    become one of my favorites of all time. I think it really helped that I didn't have any
                    expectation for the game, I know a lot of people expected an RPG with dialogue and decisions and
                    character progression, and of course were disappointed with a mostly linear game. Meanwhile I
                    came in expecting to shoot a bunch of goons for about 10 hours and was happily surprised with
                    100 hrs of beautiful realistic and well acted characters, a compelling story, and very fun
                    gameplay. Johnny Silverhand lives rent free in my head.

                    I bought and played Lethal Company at a good friend's insistence and enjoyed it when we played
                    together. The whole enjoyment of the experience came down to us yelling at each other, screaming in
                    fear, and having a goofy time. The game itself served as a good enough medium which is all I think
                    it was ever meant to be.

                    The aesthetic and presentation are on point but the gameplay is lacking. It may just be that I am
                    not into boomer shooters but I often find myself either lost or bored of the repetitive gameplay. It
                    may be accurate for a boomer shooter to have generic enemy AI and a simplistic world design but it
                    doesn't excuse the lack of fun. If it weren't for the presentation and general polish, I would say
                    this is a mediocre game getting propped up by the 40K IP.

                    just think "what would a cat do" and inevitable the game would reward that behavior. Wonderful.

                    100+ hours of playing I had beat every single boss solo and completed the game. I really enjoyed my
                    time with it, as is apparent from how long I spent playing. Obviously this took months as I do not
                    have as much free time as others. For the record I played as a samurai and I used the starting gear
                    through the whole game.

                    as can be seen in my critters page. But it always feels wrong to observe an animal in captivity,
                    clearly they are not meant to be where we have put them, and so they will never behave how they
                    truly would in their natural environment. ABZÛ attempted, and I would argue succeeded, in letting
                    you unobtrusively observe aquatic environments up close and personal. It will never be at good as
                    deep sea diving, but I don't intend on ever doing that so this is more than good enough. Highly

                    run and some speed runs. I really love this game, it just sounds and looks and plays so right. You

                    <strong>Apex Legends</strong><br /><br />
                    was really into Apex back when it first came out. The match making was great, characters were fresh,
                    and the gameplay was really fun. I admit I didn't win very many times but I did have a great time.
                    It became less fun as people got really good at the game and were still matched with me. I don't
                    have much time to practice so I don't get all that good, and I'm old. Cope. Either way I dropped off
                    the game. I'm glad I played it when I did.

                    I played Genshin Impact instead of studying for a math exam. I was pretty hooked for about a week,
                    right around launch. Traversal was good enough and for a mobile game it was fairly impressive. It
                    was still a shallow gacha game and I soon lost interest when the grind set in.

                    Hands down one of my favorite games of all time. My first playthrough was absolutely blind and I
                    found the game completely enchanting. The voices, the painterly aesthetic, the characters and
                    choices that affect them. I loved every bit. Then I played it again and found even more to love.
                    This game and it's amazing writing has concretely changed me as a person.

                    the tank felt organic. I eventually got MS3 on steam and played it though one afternoon and while it
                    could never recapture the feeling of feeding a machine quarters after a day at the pool, it did
                    scratch the itch for great design.

                    <strong>Borderlands 2</strong><br /><br />
                    Definitely the best Borderlands game in the series. The first game was very rough and I didn't play
                    it much at all. The others in the series went overboard and by then I was too old for that type of
                    humor. Borderlands 2 hit just the right kind of tone at the right time in my life so it just
                    clicked. My first ever cosplay was that on a borderland psycho. The best part of the outfit was my
                    hand made mask, which survives to this day.

                    <strong>Dwarf Fortress</strong><br /><br />
                    I have been playing Dwarf Fortress on and off since around 2010. Back then I neither understood nor
                    could run the game effectively, but I was still enamored by the possibility and the stories people
                    created in the game. I followed development and bought the game as soon as it released on Steam
                    because I felt the need to give back to the game devs who had created such a wonderful game and
                    shared it with the world for free for nearly as long as I have been alive. Now with native graphics,
                    mouse controls and all the rest it is one of the greatest games of all time.

                    Age of Empires II has a special place in my heart. I haven't played it in a long time and I was
                    never
                    particularly good at it but it is one of the oldest games I remember playing, alongside minesweeper
                    and pinball. I absolutely love the art, the way the units move, the carefully designed buildings.
                    The sound effects are ingrained into my brain. The villager spawning breath, the enemy contact
                    bells, the quips, the wololo. I'm no good at RTS games, I don't have the will to get good, but AoE2
                    will always be one of my favorite games of all time.

                    like being the victim of horror games. When instead playing as a formless mass of vitriolic meat, I
                    am much more at ease. Who amongst us isn't a formless mass of vitriolic meat once in a while?
                    Anyway, I enjoyed a quiet summer day morning playing Carrion and left feeling it had lasted exactly
                    as long as it should have.

                    I never play horror games but this one is something different. Maybe it's more horror themed action?
                    Whatever the category, it is one of my favorite games, especially having played it the first time on
                    the hardest difficulty. I got into a flow where I knew exactly how many bullets each one of my guns
                    had and how much time I had on my air filters. No UI, extreme difficulty, amazing game.
