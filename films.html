                My thoughts on the films I have watched. This list only goes back a few years but in that time I
                have watched a lot of movies. I don't have a lot to say about every movie, sometimes it's just
                something I watched a few years back.

                    <strong>The Eid Gift</strong><br /><br />
                    The Zionists steal your home, murder your family, ethnically cleanse the land, wage genocide on your
                    people, and occasionally offer you the opportunity to visit home (you must pay them for the
                    privilege of course and purchase their goods while you are there.) do you take it offer? It might be
                    the only time you ever get to see your stolen home. You might be martyred by them before the next
                    chance, before liberation. This impossible question is at the center of the documentary short film
                    The Eid Gift. The answer may appear clear now but the reality is far more difficult.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Salt of this Sea</strong><br /><br />
                    It's one thing to read about Palestine, talk to Palestinians, watch the news of Palestinian events,
                    it's a whole other thing to experience Palestinian stories. The film may be fictional, but the
                    checkpoints, the harassment, the abuse, the danger, the dispossession, the frustration and anger and
                    pain. That is all real.<br /><br />

                    Salt of this Sea follows a Palestinian women as she returns to her homeland and finds it filled with
                    a hostile and brutal occupier. Her mobility, language, appearance, love, and mere existence is an
                    act of rebellion against the tyrannical apartheid state. You see plainly the Banality of Evil as
                    everyone from TSA to illegal occupier participates in the oppression. Even those who seem outwardly
                    progressive are shown to be simply acting the part in the shallowest sense.

                <p>
                    <strong>Digimon the Movie</strong><br /><br />
                    This movie felt like three movies trimmed down and senselessly smashed together, because it was. It
                    made absolutely no sense and having never watched Digimon I was extra lost. But the dialogue was
                    hilarious and the theme song goes so hard it almost makes me want to watch the recent uncut
                    re-release with new English dub.

                    <strong>Pokemon: Mewtwo Strikes Back</strong><br /><br />
                    This is a surprisingly bad movie, it's not even funny bad. Devoid of context and stakes, poorly set
                    up and completely shallow and unrelatable characters. These aren't even high standards in children's
                    cartoons, there are other Pokemon movies and shows with far higher quality. Anyway, this is junk.

                    <strong>Beau Is Afraid</strong><br /><br />
                    Super weird movie where the main character is a very normal man in a very weird and scary world, and
                    his response is chronic terror. A great watch with friends especially when one randomly pops in to
                    check it out mid stream and gets very confused.

                    <strong>Killers of the Flower Moon</strong><br /><br />
                    Nothing short of amazing. The film is slow rolling crime and the noose gradually tightens until the
                    end where some semblance of justice is served. Then the film goes "Oh by the way, all of that
                    happened for real" and you can't help but feel it all over again. Worth every minute.

                    living room window and I was all on board. Love it, love the watermelon song.

                    <strong>Falling Down</strong><br /><br />
                    This is a fictional film, but is it really? I've met guys like this, I'm sure they were even worse
                    back in those days. Sure, the events of this particular movie aren't real, but events and people
                    like them have. Sometimes we forget that California became so rich because of all the war criminals,
                    war profiteers, and war mongers. This "defense" engineer, which is a misnomer in and of itself, this
                    war engineer is just one of many. Plenty more don't lose their jobs and go on a rampage, instead
                    being praised and well compensated for the hell they unleash.

                    you haven't read the book first. I really hope there is an extended cut like the Lord of the Rings.

                    Another weird Cage classic for the books. This one feels like a mild black mirror episode elevated
                    by Cage's acting. Good film!

                    It was okay. Nothing stood out as particularly compelling, the main characters journey was not very
                    interesting, and the outcome was boring. The dream-like oddness of the setting made it hard for me
                    to latch on, it felt as arbitrary as old folk tales. It's like I'm missing a significant cultural
                    context that I would only have if I was a medieval peasant.

                    disappoint. The ship has an incredible design, the mission is plausible, and the execution is
                    perfect.

                    When this movie first came out I completely skipped it because I never watch trailers and I
                    misunderstood it to be more of a documentary about Hollywood. I don't know what gave me that
                    impression given the director. Eventually I did watch it and I'm really glad I did. The tension in
                    the commune, the crime, the balance of the two leads, the dog. Great movie as usual by Tarantino.

                    Capitalism is not the solution to oppression, it is the root cause. Women becoming the oppressor
                    solves nothing and isn't what feminists at large want. But the film clearly would rather present a
                    "Conservative Capitalist" antagonist who is defeated at then end of the film not through revolution
                    but through willingly transforming into "Progressive Capitalism". The film claims that nothing
                    really needs to change in the world, we just need some female representation in the oppressive
                    class. But no. Capitalism can cover itself in Kente cloth, wear high heels, hold a rainbow flag, but
                    it is still the cause of the world suffering. Don't be fooled by false promises.

                    11. One thing that stands out though is Don Cheadle's accent. What were they thinking with that?

                    before watching it so I had a whole mental picture of what
                    it should look like which was also informed by the aesthetics of modern science fiction films. I
                    didn't expect it to look like Dune, but I at least wanted to see something like Alien. Instead I got
                    something far worse than the David Lynch Dune and that is horrendous. Bad pacing, bad visuals,
                    boring acting, didn't like HAL. Maybe I'm just a hater (entirely possible) or maybe the book set too
                    high of a bar (unlikely, the book wasn't mind blowing either) but I just hate this movie.

                    I did not expect a D&D movie to be made and certainly did not expect it to be this good. When I saw
                    it was first announced I expect it to be filled with 4th wall breaks and tabletop references like
                    dice rolls and such but no. They took it seriously and made a really good action comedy. It was
                    really nice to see all these fantastical creatures brought to life in such a beautiful way.

                    You take a weird guy, immiserate him under capitalism, and present him with an opportunity to make
                    money never mind the ethics. What you might get is Nightcrawler. To be clear, he is still a bad
                    creepy weirdo for doing what he does in the film but it sure it a great car crash to watch happen.
                    Something about Jake makes me think it's not all acting.

                    <strong>Dune - Part One</strong><br /><br />
                    Back when the film was first announced I immediately knew I had to read the book first. So I made
                    sure not to watch any trailers (as usual) and read the book and loved it. Then I watched the film on
                    release. There are whole massive chunks of the book entirely missing, but what is shown is
                    incredible. I was wholly engrossed for the entirety of the film. The sound, the music, the visuals,
                    the whole experience was exceptional. One nitpick is that the arabic pronunciations are abysmal,
                    were there no available language coaches? Anyway, I eagerly await the <a

                    <strong>Castaway on the Moon</strong><br /><br />
                    This was one of the first, if not the first, Korean film I ever watched and I instantly knew I
                    needed more. It's funny, it's sweet, and it shows the struggles of the people left behind by South
                    Korea's extremely capitalist society, what more can you ask for? I'll tell you what more you can ask

                    <strong>Ponyo</strong><br /><br />
                    Ponyo was the first ever Ghibli film I watched and it has stayed close to my heart ever since. The
                    theme song is etched into my brain, I whistle it without realizing I am. The little steam boat toy
                    got me interested in the physics of how it worked, and the Morse flash light Sosuke has is one of my
                    most wanted trinkets.
