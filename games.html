                <p>
                    Here live some of my thoughts on the games I have completed or played enough of. Sometimes I have a
                    lot to say about the games I spend hours playing. Sometimes I play a game for a few hours, think
                    it's neat, and put it down forever.

                        I have to admit I was a huge hater when this game came out. I had absolutely no hype for it,
                        didn't watch any trailers and new very little about it. So to me, all I saw was a game
                        struggling and floundering, and developer promises broken and a poor product sold at full price.
                        I wrote the game off and moved on. Fast forward to the 2.1 patch. On a whim I broke my promise
                        of never playing this game and bought it and the DLC on sale. Little did I know the game would
                        become one of my favorites of all time. I think it really helped that I didn't have any
                        expectation for the game, I know a lot of people expected an RPG with dialogue and decisions and
                        character progression, and of course were disappointed with a mostly linear game. Meanwhile I
                        came in expecting to shoot a bunch of goons for about 10 hours and was happily surprised with
                        100 hrs of beautiful realistic and well acted characters, a compelling story, and very fun
                        gameplay. Johnny Silverhand lives rent free in my head.

                        <strong>Monument Valley</strong><br /><br />
                        A cute little game kill a few hours. None of the puzzles were stumpers but the vibes were clean
                        and it didn't overstay its welcome. I also played the bonus levels and found them to be about
                        the same. I first learned about this game from House of Cards. That did not age well, but the
                        game was good enough to survive that hit.

                        <strong>Downwell</strong><br /><br />
                        I played a bit of Downwell on Play Pass. I found it to be okay, nothing compelling. Obviously
                        it's only meant to be a little mini game but it didn't have the draw found in Flappy Bird or
                        2048.

                        <strong>Slay The Spire</strong><br /><br />
                        I played this game in short bursts on my phone over the course of a week. I think that is really
                        what it was designed for, I can't image sitting down at a computer and focusing on it. The
                        mechanics have enough depth to be engrossing until the end of the game. I slew the spire and
                        unlocked all 4 characters, though The Silent was my favorite and was the one I used to beat the
                        game. Overall a very enjoyable experience.

                        <strong>Final Fantasy Tactics</strong><br /><br />
                        A foundational game with absolutely beautiful artwork and animations. I would watch an
                        un-narrated long-play of this game just to follow the story. Though I do not have much patience
                        for the difficulty mainly due to the clunky interface and slow time to get back in the fight. I
                        have played hours of this game and enjoyed them but I have to put it down.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="parent">

                        <strong>Sifu</strong><br /><br />
                        I had a passing interest in the game and finally decided to pick it up after Jacob Geller made a
                        video about it. It has such an amazing progression, from the episodic aging to the true ending.
                        I started out as I assume most do, running around getting hit, dying, barely making it through
                        levels. But as I got better at the game I slowly mastered the flow of bait and punish, as well
                        as the rush and strike. I easily made it through large portions of the game untouched and
                        finally finished the game first in the bad ending and then the good. The bonus stages were also
                        a blast. In a strange turn of events, this game caused me to want to play Sekiro. I needed more
                        of that beautiful parrying gameplay. <br />
                        Side note: I played on Linux and experienced a GPU memory leak. The game would get progressively
                        slower until it became a slide show and I had to reboot it. I finally found the cause in one of
                        the graphics settings and it was fixed.
