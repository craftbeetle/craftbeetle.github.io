                Should I stay or should I go?<br /><br />
                This is not a new question, it isn't informed by recent events. Though those events haven't helped, the
                alternative would not have changed my mind. Those who came before me asked the same question and landed
                on go. Now I am asking the same and considering the options.<br /><br />
                Should I cut my roots and become a stranger again? The last time I didn't have strong roots but I also
                didn't have resistant branches. This time my roots are deeper but my truck and branches are much more
                solid. I could move to more fertile soil or work against the tide to repair the local erosion.<br /><br />
                Should I end my complicity in these evil systems or should I stay and resist them? My mere existence
                here fuels their system and resistance from without is crippling the beast. They always say that you
                cannot change a system from within yet leaving would help me and leave others behind to struggle.
                Is it wrong that I can leave when others cannot? Was it wrong that those before me left when others
                could not?<br /><br />
                Do I owe this place anything? Is divestment resistance? Should I go back home or find a new home? Will
                it be any different anywhere else? Would I still be a stranger in my own home? Could I ever find peace
                where I am? Are the cost and effort of staying greater than those of leaving?<br /><br />
                I might find life better away from the fire, where the embers fall. I might be able to build a real life
                where people actually think about their neighbors. I might be able to find peace where the stakes are
                low, opportunities are few, but failure is mild. Where taxes don't fund genocides, where streets are for
                human beings, where food isn't deadly, where the future looks up.<br /><br />
                Am I willing to take the risk, to give up my global advantage, to gamble with my future, to reset my
                social life?<br /><br />
                I'll think about it a bit more, search for a new home, try to find reasons to stay, do my due
                diligence.<br /><br />
                So I ask:<br />
                Should I stay or should I go?<br /><br />

                <strong>24.08.25</strong> <br /><br />
                Humans have had their Neural Networks trained over hundreds of thousands of years. Our brains
                already have all the pathways and connections necessary to process and generate visual, auditory,
                linguistic, and other types of information. When a human is born, they are not beginning their
                training but instead are simply fine-tuning an ancient model for new languages, art forms, and
                ideas.<br /><br />
                Generative AI on the other hand does not have this benefit. It requires massive amounts of high
                quality data to train. It also has the critical pitfall of not being able to train on its own
                outputs because it isn't the center of its own existence. Humans can train on human material because
                we live for ourselves. AI exists for our benefit, we aren't interested in what the AI thinks, we
                want it to emulate what we think.<br /><br />
                So an problem is created when we use AI to generate, then post those generation back to the
                internet, which then goes back into the AI. Soon, the AI will develop the computational equivalent
                of prion disease. And the stakeholders of AI companies know this. How then will they get around this
                issue?<br /><br />
                One possible solution for them to access fresh, high quality data is by harvesting it right at the
                source. No longer relying on the intermediary of scrapping the internet, the AI companies will
                instead contract directly with governments, intelligence agencies, data brokers, and communications
                companies to record everything in our lives and use it to train AI. How will this look?<br /><br />
                Expect to see changes to the terms and services of the various software and hardware you use saying
                something like "By using this product, you are consenting to us collecting your information for AI
                training purposes. Don't worry, we pinky promise that it's all anonymous.". You might expect to see
                high speed internet become cheap or even free, so long as the ISP can see what you are doing. You
                might find that your new phone has an always on camera/microphone for "theft protection" or
                "security". Your government ID will become a high resolution 3D scan of your face, security cameras
                will become 8K with film quality microphones, your email will read everything that goes through it,
                all for the purpose of training AI.<br /><br />
                I hope this doesn't come across as fear mongering or conspiracy theory. Worry not dear reader, I do
                believe we landed on the moon, that vaccines do work, and that 5G is just internet. I simply as you
                to read the terms of service of the products you are using. This issue has already been demonstrated
                by <a href="https://youtu.be/EXxMCm941WA" target="_blank">Adobe</a>, and
                <a href="https://youtu.be/JiMXb2NkAxQ?feature=shared" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I'm also not
                anti-AI by default, but I do agree with many arguments against its training and use. I write this
                website myself, without the use of generative AI for my writing or images. If you see it or read it
                here, it's "real". If I ever do use AI in a project in the future, it will be made very clear.

                Passive consumption is their aim for us. They seek to make us drones of capital, laboring, and being
                pacified with treats and controlled opposition. The 2 minutes of hate as Orwell put it. Even
                revolutionary seeming media is still designed to be a surrogate for real action. We want a movie
                about some rebels and we relate to the rebels. In doing so we think that we have somehow struck at
                the empire. This feeling acts as a release of our feelings and a pacification.
                <br /><br />
                To affect real change you have to get up and do something. Go outside and meet your neighbors. Feed
                those who don't have food. Attend book talks, protests, and fundraisers. Connect with the people and
                build that lasting change you want to see.

                <strong>24.07.30</strong> <br /><br />
                You wake up and find every is wet. At first you don't even know what to do. Maybe you do nothing,
                maybe you do something that helps, maybe you do something makes things worse. Then, for whatever
                reason, you finally decide to call a plumber. <br /><br />
                "Hello plumber, my house is wet."<br /><br />
                "I see, well that is called flooding. It happens when you have a hole in the roof, or a faucet is
                open while a pipe is clogged, or you're in a hurricane."<br /><br />
                So you check open the curtain, no hurricane.<br />
                You check the roof, no hole.<br />
                You check the bathroom, flooded.<br /><br />
                Now what? You try to mopping but it just moves water around. You try to scoop it out but you get
                tired and it gets bad again. You give in and close the faucet. Now the house is still flooded but at
                the very least it's not getting worse. You start scooping water out and it lowers the level in the
                bathroom, you mop and it dries the floor enough to work. Now's the hard part. You have to fix the
                pipe. It takes a lot of effort, help, and time, but eventually you give it all straightened out.
                Does that mean you're done?<br /><br />
                Not quite. You're house is still in pretty bad shape. All that water damaged walls and ruined
                furniture. You now set about replacing furniture, saving what can be saved and tossing what can't.
                It hurts to see the damage but you push on. You even rip up the walls and find more structural
                damage that you then go on to fix. Then you mop again, and paint, and you're done.<br /><br />
                You can open the faucet again. And in this process, you also learned how the things in your home
                really work. What is truly valuable to you, and what to do when things break.
