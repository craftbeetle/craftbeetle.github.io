                    <strong>24.08.25</strong> <br /><br />
                    Humans have had their Neural Networks trained over hundreds of thousands of years. Our brains
                    already have all the pathways and connections necessary to process and generate visual, auditory,
                    linguistic, and other types of information. When a human is born, they are not beginning their
                    training but instead are simply fine-tuning an ancient model for new languages, art forms, and
                    ideas.<br /><br />
                    Generative AI on the other hand does not have this benefit. It requires massive amounts of high
                    quality data to train. It also has the critical pitfall of not being able to train on its own
                    outputs because it isn't the center of its own existence. Humans can train on human material because
                    we live for ourselves. AI exists for our benefit, we aren't interested in what the AI thinks, we
                    want it to emulate what we think.<br /><br />
                    So an problem is created when we use AI to generate, then post those generation back to the
                    internet, which then goes back into the AI. Soon, the AI will develop the computational equivalent
                    of prion disease. And the stakeholders of AI companies know this. How then will they get around this
                    issue?<br /><br />
                    One possible solution for them to access fresh, high quality data is by harvesting it right at the
                    source. No longer relying on the intermediary of scrapping the internet, the AI companies will
                    instead contract directly with governments, intelligence agencies, data brokers, and communications
                    companies to record everything in our lives and use it to train AI. How will this look?<br /><br />
                    Expect to see changes to the terms and services of the various software and hardware you use saying
                    something like "By using this product, you are consenting to us collecting your information for AI
                    training purposes. Don't worry, we pinky promise that it's all anonymous.". You might expect to see
                    high speed internet become cheap or even free, so long as the ISP can see what you are doing. You
                    might find that your new phone has an always on camera/microphone for "theft protection" or
                    "security". Your government ID will become a high resolution 3D scan of your face, security cameras
                    will become 8K with film quality microphones, your email will read everything that goes through it,
                    all for the purpose of training AI.<br /><br />
                    I hope this doesn't come across as fear mongering or conspiracy theory. Worry not dear reader, I do
                    believe we landed on the moon, that vaccines do work, and that 5G is just internet. I simply as you
                    to read the terms of service of the products you are using. This issue has already been demonstrated
                    by <a href="https://youtu.be/EXxMCm941WA" target="_blank">Adobe</a>, and
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/JiMXb2NkAxQ?feature=shared" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I'm also not
                    anti-AI by default, but I do agree with many arguments against its training and use. I write this
                    website myself, without the use of generative AI for my writing or images. If you see it or read it
                    here, it's "real". If I ever do use AI in a project in the future, it will be made very clear.

                    Passive consumption is their aim for us. They seek to make us drones of capital, laboring, and being
                    pacified with treats and controlled opposition. The 2 minutes of hate as Orwell put it. Even
                    revolutionary seeming media is still designed to be a surrogate for real action. We want a movie
                    about some rebels and we relate to the rebels. In doing so we think that we have somehow struck at
                    the empire. This feeling acts as a release of our feelings and a pacification.
                    <br /><br />
                    To affect real change you have to get up and do something. Go outside and meet your neighbors. Feed
                    those who don't have food. Attend book talks, protests, and fundraisers. Connect with the people and
                    build that lasting change you want to see.

                    <strong>24.07.30</strong> <br /><br />
                    You wake up and find every is wet. At first you don't even know what to do. Maybe you do nothing,
                    maybe you do something that helps, maybe you do something makes things worse. Then, for whatever
                    reason, you finally decide to call a plumber. <br /><br />
                    "Hello plumber, my house is wet."<br /><br />
                    "I see, well that is called flooding. It happens when you have a hole in the roof, or a faucet is
                    open while a pipe is clogged, or you're in a hurricane."<br /><br />
                    So you check open the curtain, no hurricane.<br />
                    You check the roof, no hole.<br />
                    You check the bathroom, flooded.<br /><br />
                    Now what? You try to mopping but it just moves water around. You try to scoop it out but you get
                    tired and it gets bad again. You give in and close the faucet. Now the house is still flooded but at
                    the very least it's not getting worse. You start scooping water out and it lowers the level in the
                    bathroom, you mop and it dries the floor enough to work. Now's the hard part. You have to fix the
                    pipe. It takes a lot of effort, help, and time, but eventually you give it all straightened out.
                    Does that mean you're done?<br /><br />
                    Not quite. You're house is still in pretty bad shape. All that water damaged walls and ruined
                    furniture. You now set about replacing furniture, saving what can be saved and tossing what can't.
                    It hurts to see the damage but you push on. You even rip up the walls and find more structural
                    damage that you then go on to fix. Then you mop again, and paint, and you're done.<br /><br />
                    You can open the faucet again. And in this process, you also learned how the things in your home
                    really work. What is truly valuable to you, and what to do when things break.<br />
