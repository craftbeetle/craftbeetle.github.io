            <p>
                Here are the TV shows that I have watched. Some of these had my full attention for the duration,
                while others played on a second or third monitor and were mostly listened to and glanced at for
                context.

                        <strong>Firefly</strong><br /><br />
                        After years of being recommended this show and not watching it, I finally relented and I am
                        really glad that I did. Say what you will about Joss Whedon, his other works, and him as a
                        person, what he did with this show was really good. It's now my headcanon that everyone knows
                        Chinese in the future.

                        <strong>Creature Commandos</strong><br /><br />
                        While the presentation is not the finest and the writing is a little basic, I did find myself
                        really enjoying the show by the last episode. The Bride and Dr. Phosphorus are fun to watch and
                        for the first time I actually liked Amanda Waller.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Mr. Robot</strong><br /><br />
                        I was drawn to Mr. Robot because the hacking was so good, the anti-capitalist message was clear,
                        and the quality was on point. I originally watched the first season as it air and was hooked,
                        but then a fell off before the second season. I have now watched it all, start to finish, and it
                        was great. The hacking is realistic. Often times the hardest part is getting physical access to
                        the machine, then the hack itself is ransomware or sabotage. The acting and psychological aspect
                        of the show really gives it that extra kick, though I felt it became a bit too central in the
                        later seasons. One of the risks of making a show with a lot of secrets is that your audience may
                        not know enough to root for the protagonist and that happened to me in the third and fourth
                        seasons. Still the show is worth watching despite that, the characters and their internal
                        conflicts carry the show.

                        <strong>A Good Girl's Guide To Murder</strong><br /><br />
                        A Good Girl's Guide to Murder is a great mini series that shows Myers is just as good as a
                        lead actress as she is a supporting actress. It was nice to see a story set in a more rural side
                        of the UK and to have such a diverse cast used so well. As usual, I won't spoil the plot, but I
                        can confirm it is a good story well realized.

                        <strong>House of the Dragon</strong><br /><br />
                        After the sour taste of the last few seasons of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon has brought
                        back in me a cautious love for the show. As always the acting, story, and production are
                        unmatched. The winding, ever complicating political machinations and occasional bursts of
                        violence kept me glued to the screen.

                        What a beautiful show and what attention to detail. I couldn't tear my eyes off the screen as I
                        watched the dubbed 4K remaster. The animations and cinematic angles repeatedly caught me by
                        surprise. This show was first aired in the late 70s so it's easy to see the layers of paper and
                        the animation techniques. And yet, as is often the case with new art forms, the lack of other
                        works to copy creates an environment where the artists are forced to pull from the real world
                        for inspiration.

                        I remember damage. The story benefits greatly from the out-of-other telling and the comic book
                        anchor. I'm glad I randomly stumbled upon this series. I can't say much about it other than it's
                        somehow so real because of it's oddness.

                        My favorite is Chilchuck of course: clever and grumpy. I'm really looking forward to season 2!

                        Probably the most notable thing about this show, other than it being a miraculously good spin
                        off of an amazing show, is the emotional range displayed. Saul is at times funny and goofy and
                        at other times thrilling and miserable, and often these emotions are expertly are layered. Saul
                        responds to his misery with mockery. Who knew lawyering could be so fun? I guess it's only so
                        fun when you consider the law a game, a puzzle, a nut to crack.

                        You can imagine my mild surprise when I saw this show on Netflix. I assumed it was a documentary
                        style "here's how I live" kind of show, but what I found was more akin to Atlanta. Not as
                        serious or well written, but funny and charismatic enough to be worth a watch. My favorite part
                        is the bank robbery, the ending of that scene is to die for.

                        Well if you wanted to see a tiny slice of American war crimes and the reason why the world
                        (justifiably) hates the US, here it is. I watched this show amazed at how brazenly the soldiers
                        committed these crimes, not to mention the crime that is the invasion itself. Most interest are
                        the rational soldiers, like Ice Man, who did not intentionally kill civilians but nonetheless
                        willingly participate in the invasion of a foreign country and remained in a military that
                        killed civilians so frequently and coldly. How one justifies that to themselves, I'm not sure.
                        Especially the medic, did they think that all medicine is good? Do American military medics
                        think that saving the lives of child killers is a good thing? Maybe they honestly do. The most
                        chilling part of the show is the end, when you realize that it's not "based" on real events, it
                        IS real events. There is an interview online with the real soldiers in the show, and one of them
                        even played himself in the show. Incredible.

                        I loved it and I don't care what anyone says. I nearly cried every 5 minutes of the first 3
                        episodes. I don't know why, maybe it was the resolution to the long held trauma of the movie,
                        maybe it was the void left behind by the show, or the sour taste of sequel. Either way I loved
                        this show and its depiction of the characters and story.

                        The art style is perfect, the characters are great, the action is fun, the story is interesting.
                        I don't think I have ever seen a Samurai film/show that so clearly discusses the Dutch and what
                        they got up to. That may just be me though, I haven't seen everything related to the this time
                        period. This was a great watch and I can't wait for it to come back for season two.

                        <strong>Succession</strong><br /><br />
                        A viper pit. A very complex and interconnected viper pit. A pit of flawed and interdependent
                        vipers. What makes Succession work is that none of the characters can achieve their aims by
                        themselves and none can trust each other to help them. There are no allies and enemies, no
                        morality and ideology, only power. In this way it is very similar to statecraft, and one could
                        argue what states and modern companies are very similar. It's no wonder then that cyberpunk has
                        megacorps as governments in the hyper-capitalist near future.

                        If you ever wanted to understand police culture, at least in the north east in the early 2000s,
                        then this is the show for you. The writer spent years with these same police departments as a
                        reporter, so when he writes his characters they come of as incredibly real. This is not an
                        overtly copaganda show (though one could argue that in the same way that all war films are
                        pro-war, all cop shows are pro-cop). Each season has a theme and explores different facets of
                        police, politics, gangs culture, and poverty. I recommended it to anyone who will listen.

                        I had no idea they had made this show until I stumbled upon it on Amazon Prime. I had read the
                        comic one summer many years back and absolutely loved it. Watching this show was so sweet, then
                        I looked for the second season and found out the show had been canceled. What an absolute
                        tragedy. I don't think I will ever recover. Anyway, I recommend <a
                            href="books.html#paper_girls_book_review">the comic</a>!

                        The first season was confusing, the second season was kind of forgettable. Maybe this show is
                        more enjoyable if you have read all the books, or at the very least played Witcher 3. I came in
                        to the show having culturally osmosed much of the games but that was not enough I guess. Henry
                        Cavill was great of course, and the Toss a Coin to Your Witcher song is a banger, as for the
                        rest... eh.

                        later started following UK, EU, and world politics much more closely and find it even funnier

                        One of my favorite video games of all time is made into a TV show, and they nail it? I must be
                        dreaming. They killed the casting. The adaptation was on point. Fortunately the game was already
                        film like and the story was the main draw, but that did guarantee that it would be a good
                        adaptation? No. But they pulled it off anyway. This show earns its title.

                        I didn't think I would like this show so much. I don't like horror theme, I didn't watch the
                        originals, and yet it was fun watch. The story isn't anything super deep, it's essentially a
                        high school drama. It's mainly Wednesday's cold, creepy personal, contrasted with her roommate
                        that really carried the show.

                        I watched Edgerunners while I was still refusing to engage with the game so I didn't have the
                        full context but it is a prequel and I did know enough about the game and setting to fully
                        understand it. That being said, I did not like the show. I found the pacing, editing, and sound
                        were really off and just didn't work for me. I really enjoyed some of Studio Trigger's other
                        works such as BNA: Brand New Animal and Delicious in Dungeon. Something about the writing for
                        this one just wasn't it. Having now completely finished Cyberpunk and the DLC I still stand by
                        my opinion that the show just isn't very good.

                        chest and squeeze your heart. And to think I randomly found out about this show from the JID
                        music video, and even then I didn't realize it was a show promo for weeks. Incredible!
                        <br /><br /> Arcane is back! I enjoyed season two, and like the first season I did cry but I
                        won't tell you when or why, that's up to you to find out for yourself. The show remains really
                        great, the characters continue to evolve, and I was surprised when they managed to set up yet
                        another captivating cliffhanger.
