                    <strong>24.07.30</strong> <br />
                    You wake up and find every is wet. At first you don't even know what to
                    do. Maybe you do nothing, maybe you do something that helps, maybe you do something makes things
                    worse. Then, for whatever reason, you finally decide to call a plumber. <br /><br />
                    "Hello plumber, my house is wet."<br /><br />
                    "I see, well that is called flooding. It happens when you have a hole in the roof, or a faucet is
                    open while a pipe is clogged, or you're in a hurricane."<br /><br />
                    So you check open the curtain, no hurricane.<br />
                    You check the roof, no hole.<br />
                    You check the bathroom, flooded.<br /><br />
                    Now what? You try to mopping but it just moves water around. You try to scoop it out but you get
                    tired and it gets bad again. You give in and close the faucet. Now the house is still flooded but at
                    the very least it's not getting worse. You start scooping water out and it lowers the level in the
                    bathroom, you mop and it dries the floor enough to work. Now's the hard part. You have to fix the
                    pipe. It takes a lot of effort, help, and time, but eventually you give it all straigtened out. Does
                    that mean you're done? Not quite. You're house is still in pretty bad shape. All that water damaged
                    walls and ruined furniture. You now set about replacing furniture, saving what can be saved and
                    tossing what can't. It hurts to see the damage but you push on. You even rip up the walls and find
                    more structural damage that you then go on to fix. Then you mop again, and paint, and you're
                    done.<br /><br />
                    You can open the faucet again. And in this process, you also learned how the things in your home
                    really work. What is truly valuable to you, and what to do when things break.<br />
