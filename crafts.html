            <h3>Princess</h3>
            <p>
                A commission painting for a friend. It was a really fun painting process because I got to do a nice
                gradient and speckle some stars. I don't think I would have painted a princess miniature if it
                wasn't for someone else.
            </p>

            <h3>Vecna</h3>
            <p>
                I painted this resin printed Vecna mini as a commission for a friend. It was a relatively straight
                forward painting process, thought I had to be careful not to break the fragile ribbons and to match
                the color of the original Vecna art.

            <h3>3D Scanned Man and Scanner</h3>
            <p>
                A client gave me a 3D scan of the man and of the 3D scanner he is wearing. I then cleaned up the
                models in Blender, almost completely remodeling the scanner, and printed them on my resin printer. I
                then painted them. They were very happy with the result and I got to try out new techniques and flex
                my modeling skills. The skin was definitely the hardest part.

            <p>
                This was my submission into a local game shop's painting competition. I had a really fun time
                painting it and I made a video of the whole process.

            <h3>Deathwatch Watch Master</h3>
            <p>
                I first got into Warhammer 40K to play Killteam with one of my best friends. I figured what better
                faction than the Deathwatch, the originators of the Killteams. They looked super cool and were very
                customizable to I picked up a box and got to it. What I had failed to understand was that I did not
                have an infinite budget, nor did I have infinite time to paint, learn, and play. I now have a lot of
                cool minis that I do nothing with.

            <h3>Industrial Terrain</h3>
            <p>
                I built this terrain out of bit and bobs and junk. A soda can, some bendy straws, nuts, bolts,
                tubes, and wires all tied together with a muddy, rusty paint job. Some minis for scale. The
                inquisitor on top is a kitbash of a bunch of parts I felt went together well.

            <h3>Dragon Diorama</h3>
            <p>
                This was the very first model I airbrushed. One of my best friends came over and lent me his and
                showed me how to use it. I didn't do anything impressive but I loved how fast it painted and how
                even the coats were. Needless to say I had my own not too long after.

            <p>
                I hacked these miniatures together on Blender from parts I bought and some I found for free on
                various sites. The three animal headed gangers are directly inspired by Mutant Year Zero: Road to
                Eden. I really enjoyed making them unique.

            <h3>Knolls</h3>
            <p>
                Knolls are one of my favorite DnD beasts. I know the lore has them classed as inherently evil but I
                reject the concept of "inherent evil". These are just some irritated hyenas and we can befriend
                them if we're cool.

                I spent a day in the aftermath of a hurricane, while the power and internet were out and the
                generator was running, making this diorama with one of my best friends. He did an absolutely amazing
                job painting the miniatures while I hacked together the destroyed building they're pillaging.

            <h3>Rucksack</h3>
            <p>
                I designed and made this rucksack in my junior year of highschool and it has served me well for many
                years. I used it daily through the end of high school, all of college, and for years at work. I recently
                purchased a Goruck GR1 for travel and work and I am very happy with it, but this rucksack is still my
                go-to for outings to the beach or event near home. I made it with real canvas and Palestinian suede. The
                inner lining is a cotton. I hand stitched it all while binge watching Narcos.

                for my highschool sophomore world history class. The teacher only asked for a regular report, typed out
                and printed MLA style but he also didn't I couldn't be creative with the presentation. You can read it

            <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender Playing Cards</h3>
            <p>
                Many years ago I made a set of Avatar: The Last Airbender playing cards. After watching the first
                season of the live action show, which was very good by the way, I decided to share these cards with
                everyone.
